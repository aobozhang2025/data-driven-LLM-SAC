question
synthesis of 0.25% single atom Pt supported on α-MoC

answer
The catalyst is prepared by impregnation with metal precursor chloroplatinic acid and support α-MoC

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. samples with 0.25 wt% Pt loading was passivated α-MoC
2. The slurry was stirred for 2 h under Ar protection. 
3. The liquid was removed using a rotary evaporator under vacuum at 35 °C. 
4. Finally, the powder was put in a frozen dryer overnight to remove the residual moisture.
