question
Synthesis of single atom Co supported on WxC, denoted by Co-WxC. 

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor cobalt acetate tetrahydrate

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. Firstly, 0.142 g of ammonium tungstate was stirred in 40 mL of deionized water for 30 min and the pH of solution was adjusted to be 8 with ammonia hydroxide. 
2. 0.189 g of dopamine hydrochloride was then added and stirred for 30 min following with the addition of ethanol and stirring for 12 h. 
3. The powder collected after centrifugation was washed completely with deionized water and ethanol, respectively, and dried at 60 °C. 
4. The obtained product denoted as DA-W was used as the precursor for synthesizing tungsten carbide.  
5. The DA-W powder was mixed with 0.05 mmol cobalt acetate tetrahydrate in 50 ml of deionized water. 
6. After fully mixing, the resulting dried powder after centrifugation was denoted as Co-DA-W. 
7. The Co-DA-W powder was then heated to 850 °C  with a ramping rate of 5 °C/min under N2 and maintained for 4 h. 
8. The final powder was denoted as Co-WxC.
