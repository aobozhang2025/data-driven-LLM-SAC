question
Synthesis of single Pt atoms on Ru nanoparticles. 

answer
The catalyst is prepared impregnation with metal precursor Platinum(II) acetylacetonate 

The catalyst is prepared as followed:
1. faceted Ru branched nanoparticles (0.1 mmol) and oleylamine (1 mmol, Sigma-Aldrich, 70%) were dispersed in 5.0 ml 1-octadecene (Sigma-Aldrich, 90 %) in a 25 ml two-necked round-bottomed flask. 
2. The solution was heated at 180 °C for 30 min under a nitrogen flow. 
3. Platinum(II) acetylacetonate (0.025 mmol, Sigma-Aldrich, 97%) was dissolved in 2 ml benzyl ether (Sigma-Aldrich, 98%) and slowly injected into the Ru solution at a rate of 0.2 ml min−1. The reaction was kept at 180 °C for 1 h. 
4. The synthesized nanoparticles were purified by precipitation using a mixture of toluene and ethanol and centrifuging at 1,500 r.p.m. for 5 min.
5. The nanoparticles were then loaded on 10 mg Vulcan XC carbon (Fuel Cell Store) in 10 ml hexane and the mixture was stirred overnight. 
6. The products were collected by centrifugation and stored in a vial. 
7. The carbon-loaded PtRu branched nanoparticles were heated under a 5% hydrogen/nitrogen gas mixture at 200 °C for 2 h.
