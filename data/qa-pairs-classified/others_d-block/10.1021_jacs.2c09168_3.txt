question
Synthesis of single atom Zr supported on Co, denoted by Zr1/Co 

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by a MOF synthesis framework.

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. 1.0 g Zr(NO3)4·5H2O, 0.9 g Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 9.5 g Zn(NO3)2·6H2O were dissolved with 200 ml ethanol. 
2. Then, 6.6 g H2BDC was dissolved in 200 ml DMF to form a clarified solution. 
3. Afterwards, the as-prepared two solutions were mixed under a magnetic stirring. 
4. The reaction mixture prepared above was transferred directly into a Teflon-lined autoclave and maintained at 120 °C for 12 h. 
5. After cooling to room temperature naturally, the  product was separated by centrifugation and washed subsequently with DMF and ethanol  alternately for six times. 
6. The product was then dried at 60 °C for 12 h, named as ZrCoZn-MOF.  
7. The ZrCoZn-MOF precursor was calcined under air at 400 °C for 12 h to form ZrCoZnO sample. 
8. The ZrCoZnO was further reduced to Zr1/Co sample under H2 at 380 °C for 4 h.
