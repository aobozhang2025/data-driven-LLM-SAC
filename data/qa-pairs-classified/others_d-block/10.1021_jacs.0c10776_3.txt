question
synthesis of single atom Ni supported on α-MoC 

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with precursor Ni(NO3)2•6H2O and support α-MoC

The support α-MoC is prepared as followed:
1. Ammonium paramolybdate (MA, (NH4)6Mo7O24•4H2O) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. 
2. The grinded powder of MA was calcined in the muffle oven to 500 oC at the rate of 10  oC/min to synthesize the precursor MoO3. 
3. Then 0.8 g MoO3 was loaded into the tubular quartz reactor and placed in a vertical furnace. 
4. The powder was heated to 700 oC in NH3 (100 ml /min;  pre-purified gas) at a rate of 5 oC/min and kept at 700 oC for 2 h. 
4. After the sample was cooled to room temperature, the gas was then switched to CH4/H2 mixture (100 ml/min; 20/80 v/v), and the temperature was increased to 700 oC/min at 5 oC/min and held at 700 oC /min for 2 h. 
5. Finally, the  sample was passivated at room temperature using a 0.5 % O2/He gas mixture. By elemental  analysis, the Mo/C ratio is around 1:0.8. 

After α-MoC is prepared, the catalyst is synthesized as followed:
1. Appropriate amount of  Ni(NO3)2•6H2O precursors were loaded on passivated α-MoC support to obtain the desired loading.  
2. The slurry was stirred for 3 h, dried using vacuum evaporation first, and then transferred to freeze dryer drying overnight. 
3. Before using for catalysis, the catalyst was pretreated with CH4/H2 mixture  (15/85 v/v) with the rate of 10 oC/min to 590 oC, holding at 590 oC for an hour.
