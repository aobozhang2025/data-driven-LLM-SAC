question
synthesis of single atom Rh supported on MoS2 nanosheet

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with support MoS2 nanosheet

The support MoS2 nanosheet is prepared as followed:
1. hexaammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate (1 mmol, (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O) and thiourea (30 mmol) were dissolved in deionized water (35 mL) under vigorous stirring to form a homogeneous solution. 
2. Then, the solution was transferred into a 45 mL Teflonlined stainless steel autoclave and maintained at 220 °C. 
3. After 18 h, the reaction system was allowed to cool to room temperature. 
4. The final product was washed with water and absolute ethanol for several times to remove possible ions, and then dried at 60 °C under vacuum. All the materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. 

After the preparation of 2D MoS2 nanosheets, the synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. The MoS2 was firstly dispersed in the aqueous solution and then the corresponding Rh precursors were slowly dropped in above mixture solution. 
2. After stirring at room temperature for 2 hours, the mixture was filtered out and then the obtained catalyst was dried at 60 oC for 12 hours in air without further calcination in case the structure of 2D MoS2 was collapsed at high temperature.
