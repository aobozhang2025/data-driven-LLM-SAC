question
Synthesis of single atom Ru supported on Co, denoted by Ru1/Co

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by a MOF synthesis framework.

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. 60 mg ruthenium (III) chloride hydrate, 0.9 g Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 9.5 g Zn(NO3)2·6H2O were dissolved with 200  ml deionized water. 
2. Then, 6.6 g 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (H2BDC) was dissolved in 200 ml DMF to form a clarified solution. 
3. Afterwards, the as-prepared two solutions were mixed under magnetic stirring. 
4. The reaction mixture above was transferred directly into a Teflon-lined  autoclave and maintained at 120 °C for 12 h. 
5. After cooling to room temperature naturally, the product was separated by centrifugation and washed subsequently with DMF and water alternately for six times. 
6. The product was then dried at 60 °C for 12 h, named as RuZrCoZn-MOF. 
7. The RuZrCoZn-MOF precursor was calcined under air at 400 °C for 12 h to form RuZrCoZnO sample.  
8. The RuZrCoZnO was further reduced to Ru1Zr1/Co sample under H2 at 380 °C for 4 h.
