question
synthesis of single atom Pt supported on Y, denoted by Pt/Y

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor H2PtCl6

The synthesis procedures of the catalyst are as followed:
1. 10~15 mL  H2PtCl6 aqueous solution was dissolved in 40 mL water under stirring followed by addition of 300~500 μL trimethoxysilyl propanethiol dropwise. 
2. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 h and then 0.7 g NaAlO2, 4.15 g NaOH, 7.2 mL colloidal silica were added to the mixture successively, followed by an additional  stirring for 4 h. 
3. The as-formed mixture was then transferred into an autoclave for crystallizing at 373 K for 48 h. 
4. The resultant mixture was thoroughly washed with deionized water and dried at 373 K for 6 h. 
5. The dehydration sample was calcined in an air flow at 823 K for 6 h with heating rate of 2 K/min.
