question
Synthesis of single atom Pt supported on γ-Mo2N

answer
The catalyst is prepared by impregnation with metal precursor H2PtCl6 and support γ-Mo2N

The support γ-Mo2N is prepared as followed:
1. Ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O) powder (10 g) was calcined in a muffle furnace at 500 °C for 10 h to synthesize MoO3. 
2. Subsequently, 2 g of untreated MoO3 powder was nitridated in pure ammonia flow (200 ml min−1) by the following temperature-programmed procedure: heated from room temperature to 350 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1, then to 450 °C at 0.5 °C min−1 and finally to 785 °C at 2 °C min −1
3. The sample was held at 785 °C for an additional 4 h. 
4. The sample was then cooled down to room temperature and subjected to passivation using 0.5% O2/Ar (60 ml min−1) as the passivation gas overnight to yield the γ-Mo2N powder.  

After the preparation of support γ-Mo2N, the catalyst is synthesized as followed:
1. A total of 400 mg of passivated γ-Mo2N powder was introduced into 15 ml of H2PtCl6 solution of appropriate concentration and stirred in pure argon atmosphere for 1 h. 
2. The suspension was subsequently evaporated at 30–35 °C. 
3. The product was reduced at 350 °C for 2 h under 10% H2/90% Ar
