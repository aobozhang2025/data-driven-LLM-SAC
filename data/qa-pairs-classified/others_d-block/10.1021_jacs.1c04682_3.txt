question
Synthesis of single atom Rh supported on Ni2P Nanoparticles. 

answer
The catalyst is prepared with metal precursor chloroiridium acid

The single atom Rh on Ni12P5 Nanoparticles, denoted by RhSA-Ni12P5, is prepared as followed:
1. First, 2 mmol of nickel acetylacetone and 20 mg of rhodium(III) chloride were dissolved into 10 mL of OAm and 10 mL of ODE at 120 °C in an Ar-filled glovebox. 
2. The prepared transparent solution was heated to 220 °C and kept at this temperature for 1 h. 
3. Then, 8 mmol of TPP was added into the solution, and the solution was kept at 280 °C for 2 h before cooling to room temperature. 
4. The black powder was collected and washed several times with hexane and ethanol under spinning at 10 000 rpm for 5 min. 
5. The precipitate was then redispersed in ethanol and dried in air at 60 °C for 12 h.  

After RhSA-Ni12P5 is prepared, the catalyst is synthesized as followed:
1. First, as-prepared 20 mg of RhSA-Ni12P5 and 0.4 g of NaH2PO3 were mixed in a porcelain ark. 
2. The porcelain ark was placed in a tube furnace with flowing Ar. 
3. The tube furnace was heated to 300 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min and held for 2 h. 
4. After cooling to room temperature, the black powders were dried in air at 60 °C for 12 h. 
5. 20 mg of the as-prepared powder was placed into a tube furnace under Ar flow at atmospheric pressure. 
6. The powder was then heated to 350 °C for 1 h.
