question
Synthesis of single atom Pd doped by O supported on Fe2O3, denoted by Pd1-O/Fe2O3

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor Na2PdCl6 and support Fe2O3

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. α-Fe2O3 without specific facet expose was synthesized by co-precipitation of an aqueous solution of ferric nitrate (Fe(NO3)3 9H2O, 1 M) and  sodium carbonate (Na2CO3, 1 M) at 50 oC, with the pH value of the resulting solution controlled at  ~8. 
2. The recovered solid was filtrated and dried and finally calcined at 500 oC for 5 h. 
3.160 mg of Fe2O3 was suspended in a mixed solvent of 30 mL H2O and 10 mL methanol at room temperature. 
4. After Na2PdCl6 (0.02 M)  was added, the solution was degassed with Ar gas for 30 min and then irradiated for 3 h by Xe  lamp. 
5. Then the catalysts were centrifuged off, washed with water, and freeze-dried.
