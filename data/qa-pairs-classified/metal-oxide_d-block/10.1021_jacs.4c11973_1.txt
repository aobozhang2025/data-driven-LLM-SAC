question
synthesis of single atom Pd supported on TiO2

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor sodium tetrachloropalladate solution and support TiO2

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. 50 mg of TiO2 (commercial P25) was dispersed in 12.5 mL of ultra-pure water under sonication.
2. Selected amounts of sodium tetrachloropalladate solution (34 mM) was added under stirring. 
3. Following 30  min of stirring in Ar, the resultant solution was frozen with liquid nitrogen and irradiated via a 300 W xenon lamp for 4 min. 
4. The products were washed 4 times with ultra-pure water and dried at room temperature (RT) under vacuum for 12 h.
