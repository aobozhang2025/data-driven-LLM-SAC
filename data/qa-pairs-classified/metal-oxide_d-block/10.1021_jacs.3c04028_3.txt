question
synthesis of single atom Mo supported on Al2O3, denoted by Mo1/Al2O3

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor Na2MoO4

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. Al(NO3)3·9H2O (42.6 mmol) was dissolved in 40 ml deionized water forming solution A. 
2. NaOH (68.3 mmol) and Na2MoO4 (0.1  mmol) were dissolved in 40 ml deionized water forming solution B. 
3. Then, the as-prepared solution A and B were dropwise and simultaneously added to 80 ml deionized water under magnetic stirring  (~600 rpm), during which the pH of the mixed solution was kept at 8.5 by using a pH indicator.  
4. After titration, the resulted liquid was stirred for another 12 h. 
5. After washing by centrifugation  (10000 rpm) with ethanol and water alternately for 4 times, the product (MgAl-(MoO42-)-LDHs)  was dried at 60 °C for 6 h in the oven and grinded to white powder.  
6. Then, the as-prepared MgAl-(MoO42-)-LDHs were thermally reduced in H2/N2 (5% of H2)  atmosphere at 300 °C for 3 h in a tube furnace, and the Mo1Al/MgO powder was obtained.
