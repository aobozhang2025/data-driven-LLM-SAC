question
Synthesis of diverse dynamically stabilized atomic Ir supported on CeO2

answer
The catalyst is prepred by impregnation with metal precursor H2IrCl6 and support precursor CeO2

The catalyst is prepared as followed:
1. 50 mg of commercial CeO2 was dispersed in 10 ml of 20% methanol aqueous solution in a 20 ml gas-tight vial under sonication for 10 min. 
2. 2.2 mg of H2IrCl6 are diluted with H2O to make 1 ml of aqueous Ir precursor solutions. 
3. The CeO2 dispersion and Ir precursor solution were purged with Ar gas for 10 min. 
4. The CeO2 dispersion was vigorously stirred and simultaneously irradiated with UV–vis light at an intensity of 100 mW cm–2 using a xenon lamp light source (Newport). 
5. The light was irradiated for 20 min for each sample.  
6. After the CeO2 dispersion turned bluish, 0.5 ml of the Ir precursor solution was injected into the CeO2 dispersion and vigorously stirred. 
7. After 10 min of stirring, the reaction solution was centrifuged and washed with water and ethanol. 
8. The product was dried in an electric oven at 50 °C overnight
