question
Synthesis of single atom metal Co tetrahedron coordinated supported on ZnO

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by the following procedures:
1. 0.0355 mol Zn(NO3)2•6H2O (Macklin, 99.9%) and 0.045 mol CO(NH2)2 (Macklin, 99%) were dissolved in 60 ml deionized water.
2. 0.1 mmol Co(NO3)2 (Aladdin, 99%) was added with stirring. 
3. It was then transferred into 100 ml Teflon-lined autoclaves and reacted at 140 °C for 3 hours. 
4. After cooling to room temperature, the powder precipitate was filtered and washed three times with deionized water and ethanol and then dried at 60 °C for 12 hours. 
5. At last, the powder was calcined in a muffle furnace at 500 °C for 3 h and the zinc oxide catalyst was obtained by naturally cooling. 
6. The obtained powder was calcined in a muffle furnace at 420 °C for 4 h.
