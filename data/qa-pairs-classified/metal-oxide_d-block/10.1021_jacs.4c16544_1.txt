question
Synthesis of single atom Ta supported on Co3O4

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation:

The precursor CoA is prepared as followed:
1. mix 30 mL of isopropanol and 8 mL of glycerol evenly
2. add 291 mg of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate, continue stirring until the solution is clear, and transfer to a Teflon  lined stainless steel autoclave, sealed and maintained at 180 oC for 6 h. 
3. After cooling to room  temperature, the solid was obtained by centrifugation, washed three times with isopropanol, and dried in vacuum oven. 

After CoA is prepared, the catalyst is synthesized as followed:
1. 0.1 g CoA was dispersed in 20 mL deionized water under ultrasound, dispersed evenly and transferred to a Teflon lined stainless steel autoclave, sealed and maintained at 160 oC for 3 h.  
2. After cooling to room temperature, washed with deionized water and ethanol, and dried in vacuum oven. 
3. The 60 mg product was dispersed in 50 mL ethanol, and the ethanol solution containing a certain mass fraction Ta was added to the above solution.
4. After ultrasonic uniformity, the solid substance was obtained by rotating evaporation at 50 oC. 
5. The solid substance was pyrolyzed in an air atmosphere at 200 oC for 2 h
