question
Preparation of single atom Mn supported on RuO2

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with precursor manganese triacetate and support RuO2

The support homemade RuO2 is prepared by the following:
1. 0.75 g of ruthenium chloride  (RuCl3·3H2O, from Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 150 mL of water/ethanol (v/v =  1:1) solution. 
2. Subsequently, 8.6 mL of 1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH, Sigma-Aldrich)  solution was slowly added dropwise to the Ru3+ ion solution, followed by vigorously stirring for an hour. 
3. The precipitation was collected by centrifugation, washed with  water/ethanol (v/v = 1:1) solution three times, and dried overnight at 65 °C. 
4. The dried solids were annealed at 550 °C at a ramp rate of 5 °C/min for five hours in air and cooled naturally to room temperature to yield the black RuO2 catalyst.  

After the support RuO2 is prepared, the catalyst is synthesized by the following procedures:
1. 50 mg of RuO2 catalyst was introduced into 10 mL of ethanol and premixed with 3 mg of manganese triacetate (C6H9MnO6·2H2O, Sigma-Aldrich). 
2. This mixture was then ultrasonicated for 15 minutes, followed by direct drying at 70 °C
