question
Fabrication of Ni coordinated by 4 N and 1 O supported by BiVO4

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor NiCl2·6H2O (0.2 mmol)

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. NiCl2·6H2O (0.2 mmol), Zn(OAc)2 (20 mmol), and melamine (20 mmol) were mixed into the solution of methanol (150 mL) and ethanol (20 mL). 2. After refluxing and drying, the supramolecular precursor was calcinated at 450−650 °C and then increased to 800−1100 °C under a flowing argon atmosphere. 
3. Under the acid washing and ultrasonication treatment, single-atomic Ni-N4 moiety was obtained. In comparison, single-atomic Fe-N4 and Co-N4 moieties were also fabricated through  the above process by use of FeCl3·6H2O and CoCl2·6H2O replacing  NiCl2·6H2O. As-prepared single-atomic Ni-N4, Fe-N4, and Co-N4 moieties were suspended in ethanol. 
4. As-synthesized 5, 15, 25, and 35 mL of Ni-N4 solution were spin-coated onto the surface of porous BiVO4 electrodes, resulting in the formation of Ni-N4/BiVO4 photoanodes by a versatile coupling strategy under the precise regulation of the content of Ni-N4 moiety. 
5. Then, Ni-N4-O moiety on BiVO4 photoanode (noted as Ni-N4-O/BiVO4) was produced by thermal treatment at 100−400 °C for a certain time under air atmosphere.
