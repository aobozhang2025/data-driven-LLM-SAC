question
Synthesis of Pt single atom supported on hydrogenated TiO2, denoted by Pt-SA/hydrogenated TiO2  

answer
The catalyst is prepred by impregnation with metal precursor H2PtCl6 and support precursor anatase TiO2

The catalyst is prepared as followed:
1. The commercial anatase TiO2 was reduced at 500 °C in a 10% H2/Ar atmosphere for 1 h. 
2. Then, 50 mg of the as-synthesized hydrogenated TiO2 was dispersed in 10 ml of H2O in a 20 ml vial under sonication for 10 min. 
3. Furthermore, 50 μl of H2PtCl6 was diluted with H2O to make 1.0 ml of an aqueous Pt precursor solution
4. 0.5 ml of the Pt precursor solution was injected into the TiO2 dispersion and vigorously stirred. 
5. After 10 min of stirring, the reaction solution was centrifuged and washed with water and ethanol. 
6. The product was dried in an electric oven at 50 °C overnight and used for photocatalytic reactions and/or characterizations.
