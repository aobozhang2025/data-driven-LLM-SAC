question
Synthesis of diverse dynamically stabilized atomic Pt supported on TiO2, denoted by Pt-DSA/TiO2  

answer
The catalyst is prepred by impregnation with metal precursor H2PtCl6 and support precursor anatase TiO2

The catalyst is prepared as followed:
1. 50 mg of commercial anatase TiO2 was dispersed in 10 ml of 20% methanol aqueous solution in a 20 ml gas-tight vial under sonication for 10 min. 
2. A fixed amount of H2PtCl6 (50.0 μl) are diluted with H2O to make 1 ml of aqueous Pt precursor solutions. 
3. The TiO2 dispersion and Pt precursor solution were purged with Ar gas for 10 min. 
4. The TiO2 dispersion was vigorously stirred and simultaneously irradiated with UV–vis light at an intensity of 100 mW cm–2 using a xenon lamp light source (Newport). 
5. The light was irradiated for 20 min for each sample.  
6. After the TiO2 dispersion turned bluish, 0.5 ml of the Pt precursor solution was injected into the TiO2 dispersion and vigorously stirred. 
7. After 10 min of stirring, the reaction solution was centrifuged and washed with water and ethanol. 
8. The product was dried in an electric oven at 50 °C overnight
