question
Preparation of single atom Rh supported on TiO2

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor Rhodium(III) nitrate hydrate, Rh(NO3)3·2H2O (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich) and support TiO2 nanopowder with primary particle size at 21 nm  or so (Titania, ≥99.95%, Aeroxide P25, Sigma-Aldrich)

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. 500 mg of TiO2 was mixed with 50 mL of deionized water through a vigorous stirring to form a white suspension. 
2. A 3.0 mL Rh(NO3)3· 2H2O aqueous solution (2.84 × 10−3 mol/L) was introduced to the TiO2 suspension through a precise injection with a syringe pump while the solution was vigorously stirred. The nominal loading is 0.20 wt %. 
3. The new suspension was continuously stirred for 2 h more to allow sufficient spontaneous adsorption of metal ions. 
4. The pH value of the mixture was carefully adjusted to 9.5 by gradually introducing an ammonium hydroxide solution, followed by vigorous stirring for another 6 h in order to reach a steady equilibrium in solution. 
5. Then, the prepared solution was centrifuged and then dried at 60 °C overnight with a following calcination in muffle furnace at 650 °C in air for 4 h.
