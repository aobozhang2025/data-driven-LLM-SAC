question
synthesis of single atom Ni supported on RuO2

answer
The catalyst is prepred by impregnation with metal precursor NiCl2·6H2O and support RuO2

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. 0.1721 g of RuCl3 and 0.0656 g of NiCl2·6H2O (that is, RuCl3 and NiCl2 at a molar ratio of 3:1) were mixed in 150 ml of 1 M HCl and sonicated for 2 h. 
2. Carbon black (0.4 g; Cabot, BP2000) was then added and dispersed by stirring for 18 h under room temperature to ensure uniform distribution.
3. Next, the mixture was dried by using a rotary evaporator and the remaining powder was collected. 
4. The powder was annealed in a flowing Ar/H2 (5% H2) atmosphere at 900 °C for 2 h and then annealed in air at 250–550 °C (450 °C as the optimized temperature) for 3 h. 
5. After annealing, 50 mg of product was added to 20 ml of 1 M HCl and mixed at room temperature for 12 h to perform acid leaching, then centrifuged and washed with deionized water three times. 
6. Finally, the sample was dried at 80 °C in an oven for 12 h to obtain the Ni-RuO2 catalyst.
