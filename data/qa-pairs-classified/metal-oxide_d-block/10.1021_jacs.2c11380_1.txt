question
Synthesis of single atom Ir supported on α-MnO2, denoted by Ir1/α-MnO2

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor H2IrCl6·6H2O and support α-MnO2

The support α-MnO2 is prepared as followed:
1. an aqueous solution (225 mL) of KMnO4 (13.3 g) was added to an aqueous solution (67.5 mL) of MnSO4·H2O (19.8 g) and glacial acetic acid (5 mL). 
2. The resulting mixture was hydrothermal at 100 oC for 24 h. 
3. The product was filtered, washed several times with distilled deionized water, dried at 100 °C overnight, and finally calcinated in air at 500 °C for 6 h.

After the preparation of α-MnO2, the catalyst synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. Ir1/α-MnO2, 0.027g of H2IrCl66H2O was dissolved in 20 mL deionized water to form a solution, to which ammonia solution (25 wt.%) was slowly added under stirring until the solution became clear
2. and then the mixture was added to another suspension (100 mL) containing the α-MnO2 (2.000 g) with H2O2 solution (30 wt.%) under stirring at 0 oC for 0.5 h. 
3. The final suspension was filtered, washed with distilled water, and then dried at 120 oC for 24 h, followed by annealing at 500 oC in air for 6 h.
