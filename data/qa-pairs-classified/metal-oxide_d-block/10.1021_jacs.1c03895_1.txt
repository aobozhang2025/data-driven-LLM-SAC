question
Synthesis of single atom Pt supported on CeO2. 

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor H2PtCl6 and support porous CeO2

The support porous CeO2 is prepared as followed:
1. 4 mmol Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (1.736 g) and 0.48 mol NaOH (19.2 g) were dissolved in 80 ml distilled water and stirred for 30 min at room temperature. 
2. Then the solution was transferred to 100 ml Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave. 
3. After reacting at 100 oC for 12 h, the products were collected by centrifugation and washed with distilled water for several times. 
4. Upon drying in a vacuum for 12 h at 60 oC, the products were calcined at 400 oC in air for 1 h. porous CeO2 was obtained

After the preparation of porous CeO2, the catalyst is synthesized as followed:
5. 500 mg of the synthesized porous CeO2 was first dispersed in 175 mL of distilled water, and 1 mmol ascorbic acid (AA) was added to the solution. 
6. After being stirred at room temperature for 3 h, the products were collected by centrifugation, washed with distilled water several times, dried under vacuum, and denoted as CeO2-AA. 
7. 140 mg CeO2-AA particles were then redispersed in 55 mL of distilled water, and 0.01 mmol metal precursor (H2PtCl6) was added. 
8. After the mixture was stirred for 3 h at room temperature, the products were collected by centrifugation and washed with water several times. 5. After being dried under vacuum, the products were calcinated at 300 °C in the air for 5 h to remove the excess AA
