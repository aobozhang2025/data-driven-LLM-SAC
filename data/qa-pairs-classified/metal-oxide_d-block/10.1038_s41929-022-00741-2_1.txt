question
synthesis of single atom Rh supported on CeO2 nanorod

answer
The catalyst is prepared impregnation with metal precursor Rh (III) nitrate hydrate and support CeO2 nanorod

The support CeO2 nanorod is prepared as followed:
1. 1.736 g of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (Aldrich, 99.99%) was dissolved in 10ml of deionized water then added dropwise to a concentrated NaOH solution, forming a mixed solution of Ce(NO3)3. 
2. The concentrated NaOH solution was prepared by dissolving 19.2g of NaOH (Aldrich, >98%) in 70ml of deionized water. 
3. Then, the mixed solution of Ce(NO3)3 was maintained under vigorous stirring for 30 min before being transferred to a Teflon-lined, stainless steel autoclave for hydrothermal treatment at 100°C for 24h. 
4. Following hydrothermal synthesis, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature. 
5. The yellow powder thus obtained was washed with deionized water until its pH became neutral. 
6. Finally, the powder was dried at 60°C in air for 10h. 

After the support CeO2 nanorod is prepared, the catalyst is synthesized as followed:
1. 1.0 g of CeO2 nanorods was dispersed in 50 ml of deionized water. 
2. The mixture was sonicated for 10 min and stirred at 400 r.p.m. for 1 h; at this stage it is termed CeO2 aqueous dispersion. 
3. Then, 5.6 mg of Rh (III) nitrate hydrate (Aldrich, ~36% Rh basis), which provided ~2.0 mg of Rh metal, was weighed and dissolved in 20 ml of deionized water. 
4. The prepared Rh salt solution was slowly introduced into the prepared CeO2 aqueous dispersion by syringe pump at a flow rate of 0.2 ml min–1 while the aqueous solution was being stirred, creating an aqueous mixture containing both Rh3+ and CeO2 nanorods. 
5. This aqueous mixture of Rh3+ and ceria nanorods was continuously stirred for an additional 3 h. 
6. The pH of the mixture was carefully adjusted to 9.5 by gradual introduction of ammonium hydroxide solution (Aldrich, 28%) while the aqueous mixture was being stirred, followed by continuous stirring for an additional 5 h. 
7. The aqueous mixture was then centrifuged at 3,000 r.p.m. for 5 min, after which the upper layer was decanted. 
8. The solid product thus obtained was dried at 60 °C in an oven overnight and calcined in a muffle furnace at 250 °C for 2 h
