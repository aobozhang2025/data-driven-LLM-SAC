question
Synthesis of single atom Pt supported on SiO2 

answer
The catalyst is prepared by impregnation with metal precursor H2PtCl6 and support SiO2

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. H2PtCl6 solution (800 μl) of appropriate concentration was added to 1 g of hydrophilic SiO2 powder. 
2. The mixture was stirred until dry and further dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C overnight. 
3. The catalyst was reduced at 350 °C for 2 h under 10% H2/90% Ar
