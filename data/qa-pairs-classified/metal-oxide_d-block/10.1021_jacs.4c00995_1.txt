question
preparation of single atom Cr supported on Si-MFI, denoted by Cr/Si-MFI

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor Cr(acac)3 and support Si-MFI

The support precursor B-MFI is prepared as followed:
1. 1.73 g sodium  hydroxide (NaOH) and 3.55 g tetrapropylammonium bromide (TPABr) were added to 18.39 g  deionized water separately and stirred until well dissolved. 
2. The NaOH solution was added to the TPABr solution and stirred for one hour. 
3. 25 g colloidal silica solution (40% SiO2 in water) was added to the resulting mixture dropwise under vigorous stirring. 
4. Next, a solution of 0.82 g boric acid (H3BO3) in 8.2 g H2O was added to the NaOH-TPABr-SiO2 mixture, covered, and stirred  overnight. 
5. The resulting aged gel with molar composition 1 Si : 0.08 B : 0.26 Na : 0.08 TPA : 20  H2O was transferred to a 120 mL PEFT lined autoclave, sealed, and placed into an oven at 170 °C,  rotating at 30 rpm for two days. 
6. After cooling the autoclave, the solid product was separated  through centrifugation and washed with deionized water several times. 
7. The rinsed zeolite was  dried in an oven at 120 °C overnight in ambient air and calcined in flowing O2 at 600 °C to remove  organics. 
8. Next, the sample was ammonium exchanged in aqueous 1 M NH4NO3 and calcined again  in O2 at 550 °C to convert it to its protonic form before use.  

After the support precursor B-MFI is prepared, the support Si-MFI is prepared as followed:
1. 1 g B-MFI and 50 mL 1 M HCl solution were added into a sealed, pressure-rated glass vessel, and the mixture was stirred and heated in an oil bath at 90 °C for 20 h. 
2. The solid product was separated by centrifugation and washed thoroughly with deionized water. 
3. The rinsed product was dried in an oven at 80 °C overnight in ambient air and was further dehydrated and calcined at 350 °C in flowing O2.
4. The as-prepared Si-MFI was transferred into the glovebox before use.  

After the preparation of support Si-MFI, the catalyst is synthesized with the following procedures:
1. Si-MFI zeolite (up to 500 mg) and an appropriate amount of Cr(acac)3 were added into a 2 mL glass ampoule. 
2. The ampoule was transferred and connected to a Schlenk line, where it was evacuated three times and flame-sealed  under pressure below 100 mtorr. 
3. The sealed ampoule containing the light purple mixture was heated in furnace at 220 °C for 4 h, and 330 °C for 4 h, with a temperature ramping rate 5 °C/min. The sample color changed to green during this process. 
4. Next, the sample was transferred back to the glovebox, where it was removed from the ampoule and placed into a quartz calcination tube. 
5. The sample in the calcination tube was air-free transferred to the furnace, heated under 40 mL/min  air flow at 5 °C/min to 120 °C for 1 h, and 2 °C/min to 600 °C, at which temperature the furnace  was held for 6 h. 
6. After cooling down, the Cr/Si-MFI sample was transferred back to the glovebox  and stored before use.
