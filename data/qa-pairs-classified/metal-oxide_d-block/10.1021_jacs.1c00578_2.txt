question
synthesis of single atom Ru supported on self-pillared silicalite-1 zeolite (SP-S-1)

answer
the catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor RuCl3 and support SP-S-1

the support self-pillared silicalite-1 zeolite (SP-S-1) is prepared as followed:
1. 12.4 g of TBPOH solution was mixed with 3.3 g of DI water. 
2. After stirring for 10 min, 12.48 g of TEOS was added. 
3. The mixture was then stirred continuously for 6 h. 
4. The obtained clear solution was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and crystallized at 115 °C for 2 days under static conditions. 
5. The solid product was then collected by the centrifugation and washed with water several times, and then dried at 80 °C in the oven. 
6. The sample was finally calcinated in the air at 550 oC for 6 h to remove the organic template.  

after the preparation of self-pillared silicalite-1 zeolite (SP-S-1), the catalyst is synthesized as followed:
1. 435 mg calcinated SP-S-1 was impregnated with 0.1 mL of aqueous RuCl3 solution with certain concentrations. 
2. Then the sample was dried in the oven and then reduced in flowing hydrogen of 20 mL/min with linear heating to 400 °C for  2 h and then holding for 2 h.
