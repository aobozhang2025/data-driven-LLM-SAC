question
synthesis of single atom Pt supported on Al2O3

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor H2PtCl6·6H2O

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. 0.7455 g of H2PtCl6·6H2O was dispersed onto 100 g of Al2O3 support by solution mixing, and the mixture was kept overnight.  
2. The resulted powder was sequentially dried at 60 and 120 °C for 6 h, respectively, and then calcined at 520 °C for another 2 h. 
3. The aluminum oxide was in a nanoparticle morphology specially fabricated as the catalyst support with a specific surface area of 190−200 m2/g, a pore volume of 0.53−0.57 mL/g, and a bulk density of 0.54−0.58 g/ cm3.
