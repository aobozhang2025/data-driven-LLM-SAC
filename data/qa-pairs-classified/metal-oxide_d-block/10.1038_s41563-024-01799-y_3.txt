question
Synthesis of Pt single atom supported on TiO2

answer
The catalyst is prepred by impregnation with metal precursor H2PtCl6 and support precursor anatase TiO2

The catalyst is prepared as followed:
1. Commercial anatase TiO2 (50 mg) was dispersed in 10 ml H2O in a 20 ml vial under sonication for 10 min. 
2.  A fixed amount of H2PtCl6 (50.0, 37.5, 25.0 and 12.5 μl for Pt-DSA and 0.70, 0.60, 0.50 and 0.25 wt% TiO2, respectively) are diluted with H2O to make 1 ml of aqueous Pt precursor solutions.  
3. The Pt precursor solution was purged with Ar gas for 10 min
4. 0.5 ml of the Pt precursor solution was injected into the TiO2 dispersion and vigorously stirred. 
5. After 20 min of stirring, the reaction solution was centrifuged and washed with water and ethanol. 
6. The product was dried in an electric oven at 50 °C overnight and used for the photocatalytic HER reaction.
