question
synthesis of single atom Rh supported on Fe3O4

answer
the catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with precursor RhCl3 

the synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. 9.995 g Fe3O4 was first dispersed to100 mL deionized water by rigorous stirring. 
2. Then, 1 mL aqueous solution of RhCl3 (5 mg Rh/mL) was added to the suspension and mixed for 12 hours at room temperature. 
3. An excess amount of urea (urea/[Rh] = 60 mol/mol) was further added into the suspension. 
4. The Rh3+ on the support was deposited with the help of urea hydrolysis at 363 K for 6 hours. 
5. The resulting precipitate was separated, washed (with deionized water), and dried (353 K, 12 hours). 
6. The as-prepared precipitate was calcined at 723 K for 5 hours with a ramping rate of 2 K/min.
