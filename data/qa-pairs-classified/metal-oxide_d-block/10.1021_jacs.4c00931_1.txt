question
synthesis of single atom Pt supported on SiO2

answer
The catalyst is prepared by impregnation with metal precursor tetraamine platinum nitrate (TAPN, Sigma-Aldrich) and support SiO2

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. 2 g of spherical, nonporous SiO2 with an average particle size of 20−30 nm (USNano) was suspended in 100 mL of deionized water (Sigma-Aldrich) with magnetic stirring. 
2. The suspension was adjusted to pH 10 using an appropriate amount of NH4OH (Sigma-Aldrich), monitored by an electronic pH meter. 
3. After reaching pH 10, it was left stirring for 10 min, and 10 mL of a solution of tetraamine platinum nitrate (TAPN, Sigma-Aldrich) was added dropwise under vigorous stirring. 
4. The resulting suspension was left to stir for 30 min before increasing the temperature to 70 °C until all water evaporated from the dish. 
5. The collected solids were further dried at 120 °C overnight prior to calcination in a tube furnace at 600 °C for 6 h in 50 sccm dry air (Airgas).
