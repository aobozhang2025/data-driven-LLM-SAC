question
synthesis of single atom Fe supported on Ru-O nanosheets

answer
The catalyst is synthesized with the following procedures:
1. 8 mg Ru(acac)3, 0.35 mg Fe(acac)3 and 30 mg KBr were dissolved into the mixed solution of ethanol and deionized water under magnetic stirring.  
2. The mixture solution was dried at 60 oC to obtain the mixed powder. 
3. The obtained powder was placed in an alumina boat and heated to 260 oC for 90 min under Air in a tube furnace and then naturally cooled to room temperature to obtain the representative samples. 
4. The as-obtained  products were washed several times with DI water-ethanol mixture.
