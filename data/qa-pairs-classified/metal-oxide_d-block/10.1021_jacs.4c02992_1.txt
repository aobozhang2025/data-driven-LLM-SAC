question
synthesis of single atom Rh supported on CeO2

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor Rhodium (III) acetylacetylonate.

The support CeO2 is prepared by the following procedures:
1. 2 g of cerium(III) nitrate hexahydrate (Beantown Chemical, 128635) was ground with mortar and pestle, put in a combustion boat, and calcined under nitrogen flow at 350oC for 2 hrs in a tube furnace. 
2. The resulting light yellow solid was ground again with mortar and pestle and stored for later use.  

After the support CeO2 is prepared, the catalyst is synthesized by the following procedures:
1. 1 g of CeO2 powder was combined with 99 mg of rhodium (III) acetylacetylonate (97%, Sigma Aldrich 282774) and approx. 3 mL of acetone in a heated (~80oC) mortar. 
2. Rhodium (III) acetylacetylonate (97%, Sigma Aldrich 282774) dissolved completely in acetone, and the mixture was ground with a pestle until all of the acetone evaporated. 
3. The resulting powder was transferred to a combustion boat, dried at 80 oC for 30 minutes, and transferred to a muffle furnace, where it was heated in static air at 800oC for 10 hours with a 10oC/min ramp rate.
