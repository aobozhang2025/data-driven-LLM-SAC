question
preparation of single atom Pd supported on (Co0.95Mo0.05)3O4

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor palladium nitrate hydrate

The support (Co0.95Mo0.05)3O4 is prepared as followed:
1. 2.365 g cobalt (II) acetate tetrahydrate (Aldrich, 99.9 %) was dissolved in a mixture of 10 mL ethylene glycol (Aldrich, 99.9%) and 20 mL deionized (DI) water to form a pink solution. 
2. Then, another 30 mL aqueous solution containing 1.06 g sodium carbonate (Aldrich, 99.9%) was introduced to the prepared pink solution of cobalt salt through a syringe pump at an injection rate of 0.30 mL/min while the pink solution was being stirred vigorously. 
3. The formation of the precipitate was observed while the solution of sodium carbonate was being injected. 
4. 0.103 g sodium molybdate dihydrate (Aldrich,  99.9%) was dissolved into deionized (DI) water, forming the solution of sodium molybdate  dihydrate. 
5. Upon the injection of the solution of sodium molybdate dihydrate to the precipitate, the formed mixture was stirred vigorously for another 3 hrs. 
6. Then the precipitate was separated through centrifugation and then washed with DI water. 
7. The obtained solid product was dried at 60 oC in air for 12 hrs, then grinded into powder and calcined at 350 oC in air for 4 hrs. 

After the preparation of support (Co0.95Mo0.05)3O4, the catalyst is synthesized as followed:
1. 1.0 g of (Co0.95Mo0.05)3O4 black powder was dispersed in 50 mL DI water. The mixture was kept at stirring (350 rpm) for 1 hr. 
2. Then palladium nitrate hydrate with desired amount determined by the nominal loading of Pd was dissolved in water. 
3. Then, the prepared solution of palladium nitrate was injected into the aqueous solution containing well dispersed (Co0.95Mo0.05)3O4 black powder. 
4. After the injection, the solution was kept for being stirred for additional 3 hrs. 
5. Then an ammonia solution was added into the solution containing well dispersed black powder of (Co0.95Mo0.05)3O4 in a dropwise manner until the pH of the solution reached 9.5. After that, the solution was stirred for an additional 12 hrs. 
6. The solid component was collected after centrifugation (3000 rpm) for 5 min. 
7. Then, the collected solid component was dried  at 60 oC in air for 12 hrs and then calcinated at 350 oC in air to obtain the as-prepared catalyst
