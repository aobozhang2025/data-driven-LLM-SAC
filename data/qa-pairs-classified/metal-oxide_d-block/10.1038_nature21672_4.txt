question
synthesis of 2% single atom Pt supported on TiO2

answer
These catalysts were synthesized using impregnation of precursor H2PtCl6•6H2O over commercial support TiO2

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. The slurry was stirred for 3 hours in air to remove the liquid, using the rotary evaporator under vacuum at 35 °C. 
2. The material was dried at 120 °C for 3 hours, and then calcined in the muffle oven at 500 °C.
