question
synthesis of single atom Fe supported on CeO2, denoted by Fe/CeO2

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor iron nitrate

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. First, 300 mg of commercial CeO2 was depressed into 10 mL of deionized water under vigorous stirring. 
2. Afterwards, appropriate amount of iron nitrate ethanol solution (10 mg/mL) was added to the suspension for the impregnation of CeO2. 
3. The impregnated catalysts were dried overnight at 80 °C in air.  
4. Finally, the dried precursor was calcined in a muffle furnace at 800 °C for 6 hours with  a heating rate of 5 °C min-1.
