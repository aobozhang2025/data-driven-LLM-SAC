question
Synthesis of the single atom Pt supported on TiO2, denoted by Pt1/TiO2

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor H2PtCl6 and support anatase TiO2

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. H2PtCl6 was chosen as the platinum precursor, and TiO2 (1 g, anatase, Sigma−Aldrich) was added to H2PtCl6 solution (1 mL, 7.69  mol mL−1), followed by impregnation for 12 h. 
2. The slurry was washed several times with ultrapure water and then dried at 60 °C for 6 h. 
3. The as-prepared powder was calcined at 200 °C in a muffle furnace for 4 h.
