question
synthesis of single atom Pt supported on TiO2 nanorods array (NRAs)

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor H2PtCl6

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. First, the FTO glass substrates were ultrasonically cleaned in a mixed solution of acetone, deionized water, and absolute ethanol for 15 min each in sequence. 
2. In a typical synthesis, a piece of cleaned FTO substrate was placed in a 75 mL quartz vessel with the conductive surface of FTO facing down.
3. Pristine TiO2 precursor solution was prepared by adding 0.005 mol of potassium titanium oxalate to a beaker containing 30 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid (37 wt %) and 30 mL of deionized water. 
4. After being stirred for 20 min, the quartz vessel was sealed and further treated at 190 °C for 90 min at a heating rate of 15 °C min−1 and an initial pressure of 35 bar using argon gas in a single-chamber microwave synthesis workstation (Ultrawave, Milestone). 
5. After cooling down, the FTO substrate was taken out and rinsed with deionized water and anhydrous ethanol. 
6. The FTO substrate was then dried at 60 °C for 5 h in vacuum and kept in a muffle furnace at 450 °C for 120 min  (ramping rate = 5 °C min−1).  
7. TiO2 NRAs were placed in 25 mL of CH3CN containing 1 mM H2PtCl6, and the solution was subjected to UV (365 nm) light irradiation for 60 min.
8. Following irradiation, the product was CH3CN and water washing and drying.
