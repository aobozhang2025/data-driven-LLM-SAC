question
synthesis of single atom Ru supported on CeO2

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor Ruthenium nitrosyl nitrate and support CeO2 nanoparticles

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. Ceria nanoparticles were prepared from it by heating in a regular muffle furnace under static conditions at 600 oC for 5 hours. 
2. To prepare the loadings of Ru on ceria of 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 wt%, the desired amount of Ru precursor solution was dissolved in the minimum amount of water (total volume approximately equivalent to the pore of volume ceria) and added with a micropipette to the desired amount of ceria while continuously stirring with the spatula to ensure uniformity. 
3. The obtained wetted powder was dried under N2 flow at 80 oC, and then calcined at 800 oC for 1 hour in a regular muffle furnace with a ramp rate of 5 oC/min. 
4. The as-prepared Ru/Ceria powders were pressed, crushed and sieved to 60-80 mesh, and subsequently used as catalysts.
