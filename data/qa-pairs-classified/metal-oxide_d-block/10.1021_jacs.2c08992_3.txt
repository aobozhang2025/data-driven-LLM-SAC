question
preparation of single atom Pt on support (CeO2-sheets or CeO2-Polyhedrons or CeO2-Rods or CeO2-Octahedrons)

answer
The support CeO2-Sheets is prepared by the followed procedure:
 calcining Ammonium Cerium (IV) Nitrate at 650 oC for 2 h under air atmosphere

The support CeO2-Polyhedrons is prepared by the following procedures:
1. 5.0 g of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O was dissolved in 100 mL of deionized water
2. the solution was adjusted to pH 11.0 by the addition of NH4OH (3.4 M) under magnetic stirring at room temperature. 
3. The resulting gel mixture was washed with pure water, dried in an oven at 100 °C for 12 h, and calcined at 500 °C in air for 4 h.  

The support CeO2-Rods is prepared by the following procedures:
1. 0.868 g of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O was dissolved in 5 mL of deionized water. 
2. After that, 15 g of NaOH was dissolved in 35 mL of deionized water and added dropwise to the above aqueous cerium nitrate solution. 
3. After stirring for 30 min at room temperature, the suspension was transferred to a 100 mL stainless steel autoclave and kept at 100 oC for 24 h. 
4. The product was then centrifugated and washed with ethanol and water for three times each and then dried at 60 oC in an oven. 
5. The final CeO2-Rods powder was ground before use.  

The support CeO2-Octahedrons is prepared by the following procedures:
1. 0.87 g of Ce(NO3)3∙6H2O and 0.0076 g of Na3PO4 were dissolved in 80 mL of distilled water. 
2. After being stirred at room temperature for 0.5 h, the mixed solution was transferred into a Telflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 170 oC for 10 h. 
3. Then the precipitates were washed with distilled water and ethanol, then dried at 60 oC for 12 h and calcined at 350 oC for 3 h in air. 

The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor H2PtCl6·6H2O

The catalyst synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. 0.0013 g H2PtCl6·6H2O and 0.5 g of CeO2-S were dispersed in 20 mL of deionized water and magnetically stirred for 24 h. 
2. Then the water was evaporated at 60 oC under vacuum. 
3. The resulting solid was respectively reduced at 300 oC for 2 h under a flowing 5% H2/Ar atmosphere.
