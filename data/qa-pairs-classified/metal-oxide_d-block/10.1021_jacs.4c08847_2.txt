question
Synthesis of Ir single atoms embedded on NiO surface, denoted by Iremb-NiO. 

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor H2IrCl6·xH2O and support Ni-LDH

The Ni-LDH support is prepared as followed:
1. In a typical protocol, a CC substrate underwent a thorough cleansing process with nitric acid, followed by multiple rinses with deionized water and ethanol under ultrasonication. 
2. Subsequently, the CC was dried completely before the electrodeposition of Ni-LDH precursors onto its surface. 
3. This electrodeposition process occurred at −1.3 V vs Ag/AgCl for 10 min in an aqueous solution containing 0.1 M Ni(NO3)2·6H2O using a typical three-electrode electrochemical workstation. 

After the preparation of Ni-LDH, the catalyst is synthesized as followed:
1. the Ni-LDH support was directly immersed in an ethanolic solution containing H2IrCl6·xH2O (6 mg/mL) for 30 min, followed by drying in an oven. 
2. Subsequently, the samples were calcined in air at 350 °C  for 3 h with a heating rate of 3 °C min−1 (sample loading: 2 mg/cm2) to obtain Iremb-NiO.
