question
Synthesis of Ir single atoms absorbed on NiO surface, denoted by Irads-NiO

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor H2IrCl6·xH2O and support NiO

The NiO support is prepared as followed:
1. In a typical protocol, a CC substrate underwent a thorough cleansing process with nitric acid, followed by multiple rinses with deionized water and ethanol under ultrasonication. 
2. Subsequently, the CC was dried completely before the electrodeposition of Ni-LDH precursors onto its surface. 
3. This electrodeposition process occurred at −1.3 V vs Ag/AgCl for 10 min in an aqueous solution containing 0.1 M Ni(NO3)2·6H2O using a typical three-electrode electrochemical workstation. 
4. The resulting samples were subsequently washed with deionized water and ethanol and then dried at 60 °C overnight. 
5. the synthesized product underwent calcination at 350 °C for 3 h at a heating rate of 3 °C min−1 followed by natural cooling to room temperature

After the preparation of NiO, the catalyst is synthesized as followed:
1. the NiO support was immersed in an ethanolic solution containing H2IrCl6·xH2O (6 mg/mL) for 30 min, followed by drying in an oven.
2. Subsequently, the sample underwent annealing in air at 350 °C for 2 h  with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 (sample loading: 2 mg/cm2) to obtain Irads-NiO.
