question
Preparation of single atom Pt supported by TiO2 reduced by NaBH4 (BT)

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor H2PtCl6 and support TiO2 reduced by NaBH4 (BT)

The support TiO2 reduced by NaBH4 (BT) is prepared by:
1. a mixture of 1.0 g of Degussa P25 TiO2 and 2.0 g of NaBH4 was ground thoroughly for 0.5 h. 
2. The mixture was then heated in a tube furnace at 623 K for 1 h in a vacuum (< 2.0 Pa), followed by natural cooling to room temperature. 
3. The black powders obtained after the treatment were washed 6–8 times with deionized water and then dried in a vacuum oven. 
4. The BET surface area of the as-synthesized BT was measured to be 84.4 m2 g−1.  
5. The as-synthesized BT (50 mg) was dispersed in the aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide (5 M, 10 ml) and stirred for 1 h at 298 K. 
6. The suspension was filtered to obtain a precipitate, which was washed with deionized water and then dried in a vacuum oven at 353 K. 
7. The BET surface area of the as-synthesized BT-O was measured to be 98.3 m2 g−1.  

After the support TiO2 reduced by NaBH4 (BT) is prepared, the catalyst is synthesized as followed:
Pt was introduced via a wet impregnation of substrates (50 mg) with a certain concentration of H2PtCl6 aqueous solution (0.1 ml), followed by the calcination at 513 K for 2 h in vacuum (< 0.1 Pa). The prepared catalyst was stored in vacuum.
