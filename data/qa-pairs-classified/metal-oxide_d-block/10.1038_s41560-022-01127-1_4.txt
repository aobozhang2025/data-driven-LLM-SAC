question
Preparation of Pt2+ ion supported on TiO2 reduced by NaBH4 (BT) oxidized by H2O2 (BT-O)

answer
The catalyst synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor (Pt(NH3)4)(NO3)2 and support TiO2 reduced by NaBH4 (BT) oxidized by H2O2 (BT-O)

The support is TiO2 reduced by NaBH4 (BT) oxidized by H2O2 (BT-O) prepared by:
1. a mixture of 1.0 g of Degussa P25 TiO2 and 2.0 g of NaBH4 was ground thoroughly for 0.5 h. 
2. The mixture was then heated in a tube furnace at 623 K for 1 h in a vacuum (< 2.0 Pa), followed by natural cooling to room temperature. 
3. The black powders obtained after the treatment were washed 6–8 times with deionized water and then dried in a vacuum oven. 
4. The BET surface area of the as-synthesized BT was measured to be 84.4 m2 g−1.  
5. The as-synthesized BT (50 mg) was dispersed in the aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide (5 M, 10 ml) and stirred for 1 h at 298 K. 
6. The suspension was filtered to obtain a precipitate, which was washed with deionized water and then dried in a vacuum oven at 353 K. 
7. The BET surface area of the as-synthesized BT-O was measured to be 98.3 m2 g−1. 

After the support is prepared, the catalyst is synthesized by the followed:
Pt was introduced via a conventional wet impregnation of substrates (50 mg) with a certain concentration of (Pt(NH3)4)(NO3)2 aqueous solution (0.1 ml), followed by the calcination at 513 K for 2 h in a vacuum (<0.1 Pa). The prepared catalyst was stored in vacuum.
