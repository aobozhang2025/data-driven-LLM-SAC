question
synthesis of single atom Fe supported on ZSM-5 without TPA

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by seeded growth template-free method. 

ZSM-5 seeds are first prepared:
1. In the first step, 15 g of colloidal silica (Ludox HS40) was dissolved in 7 mL of a NaOH solution (1 M) under stirring at 100 °C for 1 h. 
2. A separate solution was prepared by dissolving 0.45 g of sodium aluminate in 7 mL of a NaOH solution (1 M). 
3. The two solutions were mixed to obtain a synthetic aluminosilicate gel with a molar composition of 4Na2O:1Al2O3:36SiO2:460H2O. 
4. The gel was stirred vigorously at 100 °C for 2 h and transferred to a stainless-steel autoclave for crystallization at 180 °C for 48 h. 
5. The obtained crystals were collected by filtration, washed with deionized water, and dried at 100 °C to produce the ZSM-5 seeds.  

After ZSM-5 seed are prepared, the catalyst is synthesized with the following procedures:
1. 15 g of colloidal silica (Ludox HS40) was dissolved in 7 mL of a NaOH solution (1 M) under stirring at 100 °C for 1 h. 
2. A separate solution was prepared by dissolving 0.45 g of sodium aluminate in 7 mL of a NaOH solution (1 M). 
3. The two solutions were mixed to obtain a synthetic aluminosilicate gel with a molar composition of 4Na2O:1Al2O3:36SiO2:460H2O. 
4.1.5 mL of an aqueous solution containing 0.165 g of iron oxalate (Fe loading: 0.40 wt% in the  final product) and 0.06 g of ZSM-5 seeds were added sequentially to the gel. 
5. After stirring for 30 min, the mixture was transferred to an autoclave for crystallization at 180 °C for 48 h. 
6. The obtained crystals were collected by filtration, washed with deionized water, and dried at 80 °C. 
7. ion exchange with ammonium nitrate followed by calcination in air at 550 °C for 6 h.
