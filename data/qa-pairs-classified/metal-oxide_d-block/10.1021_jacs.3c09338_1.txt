question
Synthesis of single atom Ru supported on CoAlO

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor RuCl3·3H2O and support CoAlO

The support CoAlO is prepared as followed:
1. cobalt nitrate (4.1384g, 14.22 mmol) and aluminum nitrate (2.6672g, 7.11 mmol) were ultrasonically dissolved in 20 mL of distilled water for 10 min and marked as solution A. 
2. NaOH 1.366 g was dissolved in 20 mL of distilled water to form solution B. 
3. Solutions A and B were added drop by drop into 40 mL of deionized water under vigorous stirring, and the pH was controlled at 8.5 ± 0.3 by adjusting the dropwise rate of solutions A and B. 
4. After the dropwise addition of solution A with residue, the reaction was stirred at room temperature for 16 h. 
5. The precipitates obtained were washed by centrifugation with water/ethanol twice, respectively, and dried. 
6. After grinding into homogeneous powder, the reaction was treated at 400 °C for 2h in a 5% H2/ Ar mixture with a heating rate of 5 °C/min. 

After the support CoAlO is prepared, the catalyst is synthesized with the following procedures:
1. cobalt nitrate (4.1384g, 14.22 mmol) and aluminum nitrate (2.6672g, 7.11 mmol) were ultrasonically dissolved in 20 mL of distilled water for 10 min and marked as solution A. 
2. 100 μL RuCl3·3H2O solution (20 mg/mL) and 1.366 g NaOH dissolved in 19.9 mL distilled water (RuCl3·3H2O solution was prepared through ultrasonic dissolved ruthenium chloride trihydrate 20 mg in 1 mL distilled water) to form solution B. 
3. Solutions A and B were added drop by drop into 40 mL of deionized water under vigorous stirring, and the pH was controlled at 8.5 ± 0.3 by adjusting the dropwise rate of solutions A and B. 
4. After the dropwise addition of solution A with residue, the reaction was stirred at room temperature for 16 h. 
5. The precipitates obtained were washed by centrifugation with water/ethanol twice, respectively, and dried. 
6. After grinding into homogeneous powder, the reaction was treated at 400 °C for 2h in a 5% H2/ Ar mixture with a heating rate of 5 °C/min.
