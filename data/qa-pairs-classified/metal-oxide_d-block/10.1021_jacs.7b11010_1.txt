question
synthesis of single atom Rh supported on ZrO2

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor RhCl3 and support ZrO2

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. Zirconium n-propoxide 14.4 mL (70 wt % in npropanol; Sigma-Aldrich) was diluted by adding 38.1 mL of npropanol (>99.5%; Sigma-Aldrich).
2. Aqueous ammonia (20 mL, Duksan) was added dropwise into the zirconia precursor solution with vigorous stirring and kept for 1 h. 
3. The gel was dried at 80 °C for 12 h. 
4. The dried sample was calcined at 400 °C for 4 h in air. 
5. The Rh precursors (RhCl3; Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in 10 mL of anhydrous ethanol (99.9%; Samcheon). 
6. Next, 300 mg of metal oxide supports, which are the synthesized zirconia was dispersed in 20 mL of ethanol. 
7. The two solutions were mixed with vigorous stirring and dried at 60 °C. 
8. The dried sample was calcined at 400 °C for 1 h in air
