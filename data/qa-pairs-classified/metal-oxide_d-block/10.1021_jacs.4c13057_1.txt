question
Synthesis of single atom Co supported on MIL-125-NH2

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor CoCl2·6H2O and support MIL-125-NH2

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. 120 mg of MIL-125-NH2 and 60 mg of CoCl2·6H2O were dispersed ultrasonically in 12 mL of THF. 
2. The mixture was sealed and stirred at 25 oC for 24 h. 
3. After soaking, the solid was isolated by centrifuging, washed with THF  (×3) and MeOH (×3), and dried at 80 oC vacuum oven for overnight
