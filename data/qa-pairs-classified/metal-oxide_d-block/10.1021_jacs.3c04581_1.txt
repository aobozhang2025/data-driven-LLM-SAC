question
Preparation of single atom Ni supported on MFI, denoted by Ni-MFI  

answer
The catalyst is synthesized with metal precursor NiCl2

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. 5.6 g of TEOS was added to a solution containing 9.69 g of a tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) aqueous solution (20 wt%), 1.0 g of urea, and 0.05 g of isopropyl alcohol.  
2. Then, 3.15 mL of NiCl2 (0.09 M) solution was added to the mixture. 
3. After stirring for 30 min, the initial gel was transferred to an autoclave and crystallized at 180°C for 48 h. 
4. The resulting crystals were collected by filtration, washed three times with deionized water, and dried at 80°C to obtain the as-prepared Ni-MFI-HT. 
5. The asprepared Ni-MFI-HT was then reduced in a 10 vol% H2/Ar atmosphere at 600°C for 2  h
