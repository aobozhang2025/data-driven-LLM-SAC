question
Synthesis of S-1 zeolite-encaged single atom Rh, denoted by Rh1@S-1 

answer
the catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with precursor [Rh(NH2CH2CH2NH2)3]Cl3 and support S-1

The support conventional nanosized silicalite-1 (Nano S-1) is prepared as followed:
1. Firstly, 13 g of TPAOH solution was mixed with 15.5 g of DI water under continuous stirring. 
2. After stirring for 10 min, 8.32 g  of TEOS was added. 
3. The mixture was then stirred continuously for 6 h. 
4. The obtained clear solution with the ratio composition of SiO2: TPAOH: H2O = 1: 0.4: 35 was finally transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and crystallized at 170 °C for 3 days under static conditions. 
5. The solid product was then collected by the centrifugation and washed with  water several times, and then dried at 80 °C in the oven, followed by calcination at 550 °C for  6 h to remove the organic template. 

the synthesis procedures are as followed:
1.13 g of TPAOH solution was mixed with 15 g of DI water
2. then 1 mL of [Rh(NH2CH2CH2NH2)3]Cl3 solutions (0.09 M) was added into the mixture. 
3. After stirring for 10 min, 8.32 g of TEOS was added. 
4. The mixture was then stirred continuously for 6 h. 
5. The obtained clear solution was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined  stainless steel autoclave and crystallized at 170 °C for 3 days under static conditions. 
6. The solid  product was then collected by the centrifugation and washed with water several times, and then  dried at 80 °C in the oven. 
7. Finally, the as-synthesized sample was directly reduced in pure H2  flow (60 mL/min) with linear heating to 500 °C for 2 h and then holding for 2 h.
