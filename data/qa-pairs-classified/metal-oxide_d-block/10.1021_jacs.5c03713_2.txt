question
synthesis of single atom Ru supported on SiO2, denoted by Ru1/SiO2

answer
The catalyst is prepared by impregnation with metal precursor hexaammineruthenium (III) chloride solution and support SiO2 nanopowder

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. 200 μL of hexaammineruthenium (III) chloride solution (Ru content of 2.5 mg/mL) was added into 10 mL ammonia solution (concentration of 5 mol/L), followed by the addition of 500 mg of SiO2 nanopowder. 
2. After stirring at room temperature for one hour, the mixture was filtered and washed with DI water to pH neutral. 
3. Then the product was dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for 12 hours. 
4. Finally, the as-prepared sample was reduced in 10 vol% H2/He for 1 h at 300 °C, with a theoretical Ru loading of 0.1 wt.%.
