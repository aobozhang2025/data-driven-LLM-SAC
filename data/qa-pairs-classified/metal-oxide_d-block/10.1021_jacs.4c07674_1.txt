question
Synthesis of single atom Pd supported on ZSM-5, denoted by Pd1@ZSM-5  

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation 

The MFI seeds are prepared as followed:
1. 16 g TPAOH  solution and 14.4 g TEOS solution were added into a 50 mL plastic bottle and stirred for 12 h. 
2. Then the mixture solution was transferred into 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and static crystallization for 12 h at 120 oC. 
3. After cooling down to the room temperature, as-synthesized  ultrasmall MFI seed was collected by centrifugation, washed with distilled water for four times and then freeze-dried for overnight. 
4. The final seed was calcinated in the air at 550 oC for 6 h to remove the organic template agent (TPAOH). 

After the MFI seeds are prepared, the catalyst is synthesized as followed:
1. First, 0.382 g NaOH and 0.216 g NaAlO2 was dissolved in 22.84 g distilled water. 
2. Then 0.25 mL 0.09 M [Pd(NH2CH2CH2NH2)2]Cl2 aqueous solution was added by dropwise into mixture solution. 
3. Subsequently, 5.765 g colloidal silica was slowly added into above solution and stirred for 5 h at room temperature. 
4. After that, 0.185 g ultrasmall MFI seeds were added into aluminosilicate gel and stirred for another 1 h. 
5. The mixture solution was transferred into 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and static crystallization for 24 h at 180 oC. 
6. After cooling down to the room temperature, as-synthesized Pd@ZSM-5 was collected by centrifugation,  washed with distilled water for four times and dried at 80 oC for overnight. 
7. The final sample was calcinated in the air at 400 oC for 2 h to remove ethanediamine.
