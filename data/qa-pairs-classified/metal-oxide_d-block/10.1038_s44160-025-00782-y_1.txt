question
Synthesis of single atom Pd doped by O supported on BWO

answer
The catalyst is prepared impregnation with metal precursor PdCl2/acetonitrile

The catalyst is prepared as followed:
1. First, 0.3 g Bi2WO6/amorphous BiOCl nanosheet powder was dispersed in 11 ml HNO3 (1.3 M) solution and stirred for 4 h. 
2. The products were then collected by centrifugation and washed with deionized water until the supernatant solution was neutral. 
3. After freeze-drying for 2 days, 0.15 g of the sample was treated in a tube furnace with 5 vol% H2/Ar gas at 150 °C for 5 h to introduce defects.
4. The resulting sample was named BWO. 
5. to prepare 0.05 wt% Pd–O3/BWO, 50 mg of BWO nanosheet was impregnated with 100 μl of 0.25 mg Pd ml−1 PdCl2/acetonitrile solution. 
6. After impregnation, the sample was dried at 60 °C for 30 min and then calcinated in a muffle furnace at 175 °C for 3 h. 
7. The impregnation step remained the same for preparing 0.05 wt% Pd–O4/BWO, apart from changing the calcination temperature to 250 °C.
