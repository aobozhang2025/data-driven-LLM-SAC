question
synthesis of single atom Ni supported on MgO

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by coprecipitation

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. The NixMg1−x(OH)2 precursors were synthesized by coprecipitation from a Ni and Mg nitrate solution (1 M in total) and a 1 M ammonia solution as precipitating agent, in an automated lab reactor. 
2. The equimolar mixture was chosen (as opposed to the stoichiometric one) to avoid the formation of Mg,Ni(NH3)n. 
3. While stirring at 300 r·  min−1, both solutions were dosed at a rate of 10 g·min−1 into deionized water (300 mL) at a controlled temperature of 60 °C. 
4. The resulting solution was aged for 1 h before cooled to room temperature. 
5. The pH electrode was calibrated at 25 °C with the buffer solutions pH = 7 and pH = 10 (Carl Roth ±0.02). 
6. The pH increased strongly with the first drops of ammonia (pH = 9.3) but then remained constant throughout the whole synthesis and aging processes (around pH = 8.8). 
7. The slurry was filtrated and the precipitate washed with deionized water until the conductivity was below 0.5 mS·cm−1. 
8. The light green  solid was dried at 80 °C for 15 h with a heating ramp of 2 °C·min−1  and then calcined in a rotating furnace at 600 °C for 3 h in a flow of  100 mL·min−1 consisting of 21% O2 in argon with a heating ramp of 2  °C·min−1.
