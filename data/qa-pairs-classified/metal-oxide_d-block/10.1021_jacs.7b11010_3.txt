question
synthesis of single atom Rh supported on CeO2

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor RhCl3 and support CeO2

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. The Rh precursors (RhCl3; Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in 10 mL of anhydrous ethanol (99.9%; Samcheon). 
2. Next, 300 mg of metal oxide supports, which are ceria (nanopowder, <25 nm; Sigma-Aldrich) was dispersed in 20 mL of ethanol. 
3. The two solutions were mixed with vigorous stirring and dried at 60 °C. 
4. The dried sample was calcined at 400 °C for 1 h in ai
