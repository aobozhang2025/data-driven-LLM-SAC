question
Synthesis of Ir single atom supported on B-ZrO2/SiO2

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor IrCl3·3H2O and support B-doped ZrO2 combined with SiO2

The support precursor B-doped ZrO2 is prepared as followed:
1. ZrCl4 (233 mg, 1 mmol), terephthalic acid (PTA, 0.5 mmol), and 4Carboxyphenylboronic acid (CPBA, 0.5 mmol) were dissolved in 60 mL of DMF in a vial. 
2. The slurry was then transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-liner stainless steel autoclave and heated at 120 °C for 12 h. 
3. After cooling down to room temperature, the products were isolated by centrifugation, washed with DMF and methanol three times. 
4. Finally, the product were obtained by vacuum drying of the precipitate at 80 °C for 12 h.
5. the product calcined at 500 °C in air for 7 h with a heating rate of 2 °C/min

After the support B-doped ZrO2 is prepared, the catalyst is synthesized as followed:
1. IrCl3·3H2O (31.7 mg)  and 1,10-phenanthroline (48.6 mg) (Ir : phenanthroline = 1:3 molar ratio) were added in a 100 mL round bottom flask and stirred in EtOH (30 mL) at 90 oC for 1 hour. 
2. Silica was then introduced into the above solution by in situ hydrolysis of the added Si(OC2H5)4 (TEOS) (0.8 mL) with ethanol/ammonia solution (3/2.4 mL) and the mixture was stirred at 90 oC for 2 hours. 
3. After that, B-ZrO2 powder (800 mg) was introduced into the solution and refluxed at 90 oC for 4 hours. 
4. After the mixture was cooled to room temperature, the solvent was evaporated in vacuo and the remaining soilid was dried under vacuum at 80 °C overnight. The sample was then grinded to fine particles.  
5. The ground powder was subsequently pyrolyzed under argon at 500 °C for 3 hours. 
6. After the calcined catalyst was cooled to room temperature, a gray fine powder was obtained
