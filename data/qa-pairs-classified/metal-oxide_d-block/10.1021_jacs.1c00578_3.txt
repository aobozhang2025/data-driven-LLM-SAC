question
synthesis of single atom Rh supported on self-pillared ZSM-5 zeolites ((SP-ZSM-5)

answer
the catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor RhCl3·3H2O and support self-pillared ZSM-5 zeolites ((SP-ZSM-5)

the support self-pillared ZSM-5 zeolites ((SP-ZSM-5) is prepared as followed:
1. Firstly, 12.4 g of TBPOH solution and 61 mg aluminum isopropoxide were added into 3.0 g of deionized water. 
2. After the following stirring for 10 min,  0.3 mL of 1 M NaOH solution was added into the solution. 
3.12.48 g of TEOS was then added and stirred continuously for 6 h. 
4. The resulted solution was transferred into a 100 mL Teflonlined stainless-steel autoclave and crystallized in the oven at 115 °C for 2 days under static conditions. 
5. The as-synthesized solid product was centrifuged, washed with DI water, and then dried at 80 °C in the oven, followed by calcination in air at 550 oC for 6 h to remove the organic template. The zeolite was obtained
6. 1 g of calcined zeolite was added into 50 mL H2O and stirred at 70 oC for 2 h. 
7. The solid was centrifuged, washed once with deionized water, and then mixed with 50 mL 1 M  NH4NO3 aqueous solution with continuous stirring at 80 oC for 5 h. 
8. The solid precipitate after centrifugation was dried at 80 °C in the oven. 
9. The process was repeated two times, and the resulted solid product was calcined in air at 550 °C for 4 h.  

after the preparation of self-pillared silicalite-1 zeolite (SP-S-1), the catalyst is synthesized as followed:
1. 435 mg calcinated SP-S-1 was impregnated with 0.1 mL of aqueous RhCl3·3H2O solution with certain concentrations. 
2. Then the sample was dried in the oven and then reduced in flowing hydrogen of 20 mL/min with linear heating to 400 °C for  2 h and then holding for 2 h.
