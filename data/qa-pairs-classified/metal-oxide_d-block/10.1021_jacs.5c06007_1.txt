question
Synthesis of single atom Zr supported on SiO2 

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor zirconium (IV) acetylacetonate (Zr(acac)4) and support SiO2

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. 50 mL cyclohexane was mixed with 16 mL IGEPAL® CO-630 and 2.0 mL aqueous ammonia solution in a three-neck flask and stirred for 10 min, followed by adding 50 mL cyclohexane containing 0.66 mmol zirconium (IV) acetylacetonate (Zr(acac)4), 2.0 mL tetramethyl orthosilicate (TMOS, 98%)  and 2.0 mL octadecyltrimethoxysilane (C18TMS, 90%). 
2. After being stirred for 1 h at 30°C, the solid  product was separated via centrifuging and washed thoroughly with ethanol. 
3. After drying at 80°C for 10  h, the sample was calcined in air for 2 h at 400°C
