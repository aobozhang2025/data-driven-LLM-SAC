question
Synthesis of single atom Ta supported on RuO2

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor Cu(NO3)2·3H2O

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. 875 mg of trimesic acid was dissolved in 40 ml MeOH  (solution A). 
2. Subsequently, 2.43 g of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and 1 mmol of tantalum ethoxide were dissolved in 40 ml MeOH (solution B). 
3. The Solution A and B were mixing under room temperature overnight. 
4. The as-obtained product was centrifuged and dried in a vacuum oven. 
5. Then, cation exchange process was done with the powder. 
6. In 92 ml of DI water, 120 mg of RuCl3·3H2O were dissolved. 
7. Subsequently, 200 mg of the as-synthesized HKUST-1 powder was homogeneously dispersed in the above solution, followed by vigorous shaking and sonication. 
8. The homogeneous mixture was then stirred in the dark. 
9. After 18 h of stirring, the products were washed five times with DI water and dried in a vacuum oven overnight. 
10. The dried powder was heated at 300 °C for 4 h in a muffle furnace (ramping rate of 5 °C/min). 
11. Thereafter, the calcined product was treated  with 0.5 M H2SO4 at 80 °C for 7 hours to remove the unstable metal species. 
12. Finally, the acidtreated powder was collected and washed three times with DI water, followed by drying in a  vacuum oven.
