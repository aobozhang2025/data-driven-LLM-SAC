question
synthesis of single atom Ir supported on Co-O

answer
the catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor sodium hexachloroiridate(III) hydrate (Na3IrCl6·xH2O)

the synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. 580 mg of cobalt(II) nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2· 6H2O) was dissolved in 20 mL of deionized (DI) water containing 30 mg of hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). 
2. Then, this solution was injected into 140 mL of aqueous solution with 9.08 g of 2-methylimidazole and stirred at room temperature for 60 min. 3. The purple precipitate was collected by centrifugation and washed with ethanol five times. the ZIF-67 nanocrystals was obtained
4. 100 mg of ZIF-67 nanocrystals was dispersed in 50 mL of DI water
5. then 9.5  mg (2 mmol L−1) of sodium hexachloroiridate(III) hydrate (Na3IrCl6·xH2O) were dissolved in 10 mL of DI water and added into the ZIF-67 solution slowly under stirring conditions. 
6. The reaction was quenched by centrifuging the suspension after 3 h
7. the precipitate was collected and washed twice with DI water and three times with ethanol. 
8. The Ir0.06Co2.94O4 nanocrystals were obtained  after drying the precipitate at 60 °C overnight in a vacuum oven and pyrolyzed at 300 °C in air for 4 h.
