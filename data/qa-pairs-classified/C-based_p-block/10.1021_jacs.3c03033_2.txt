question
synthesis of single atom Sn supported on N-doped carbon, denoted by SnNC 

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor SnCl2·2H2O

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. 2 mL aniline (Sigma-Aldrich) was first dissolved in 500 mL 0.5 M HCl solution. 
2. Thereafter, 5 g ammonium peroxydisulfate (APS, (NH4)2S2O8, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the solution for in situ polymerization of aniline while the mixture was kept at room temperature. 
3. The polymer suspension was kept at low temperature as long as no color change was observed. 
4. 0.4 g of the  pretreated carbon (Ketjen EC 600JC) was mixed with de-ionized water for 30 min, 
5. then it was added with PANI and stirred for 48 h to achieve a uniform suspension. 
6. Carbon supported PANI  was refluxed for 5 hours at 80-90°C and then dried at 80 °C overnight by using an oil bath. 
7. Then Tin(II) chloride dehydrate (2.5 g SnCl2·2H2O, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the dried carbonsupported PANI powder, and ball milling was performed for half an hour. pouring the powder inside a ZrO2 vial along with 10 ZrO2 beads of 5 mm diameter, at a rotation of 875 rpm. 
8. The milled powder was then pyrolyzed at 900 °C for 1 h in N2. 
9. The quartz tube was purged with N2 for 2 h before ramping the temperature at 5 °C/min up to 900 °C. 
10. The oven temperature was held at 900°C for 1 h under N2 flow, then let to cool down overnight under N2 flow. 
11. The powder was then twice  acid leached for 7-8 h at 80-90°C in 4.0 M HCl solution
12. the powder was pyrolyzed again after each acid washing, with the same pyrolysis protocol as described above, except that the pyrolysis duration was increased to 3 h.
