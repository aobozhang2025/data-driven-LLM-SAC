question
Synthesis of single atom Se doped by N supported by Carbon

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation and freeze-drying with metal precursors Se powders

The synthesis process are as followed:
1. FSe powders (10 mg), glucose (0.8 g), DICY (0.2 g) were co-dissolved into 5 mL H2O. 
2. After the freeze-drying, the pyrolysis of obtained powders at 900 °C under N2 flow with a heating rate of 5 °C min-1
