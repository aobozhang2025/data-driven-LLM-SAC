Synthesis of Ga-N5 atomic site on macroporous inverse-opal-type carbon nitride

answer
The catalyst is prepared impregnation with metal precursor gallium nitrate and template silica

The catalyst is prepared as followed:
1. First, 800 mg of dicyandiamide was mixed with 500 μl of gallium nitrate aqueous solution of 1.6 g l–1and ground evenly until the solution was nearly dry. 
2. Then, the mixture was freeze-dried for 12 h. 
3. Afterwards, the product (∼0.8 g) was mixed with silica templates (1.33 g), and calcined in argon at 520 °C with a ramp rate of 5 °C min−1 for 2 h.
4. The product was further heated to 550 °C with a ramp rate of 5 °C min −1 and kept at 550 °C for another 2 h. 
5. The as-obtained product was etched in NH4HF2 aqueous solution for 72 h to remove the silica template completely, before being washed with deionized water three times and dried under ambient conditions.
