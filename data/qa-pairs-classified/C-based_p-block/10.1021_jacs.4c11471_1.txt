question
Synthesis of single atom Al supported on carbon nitride nanotubes (CNNT)

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation and freeze-drying with metal precursor Al(NO3)3 and support carbon nitride nanotubes (CNNT)

The support carbon nitride nanotubes (CNNT) is prepared as followed:
1. 12 mmol (1.5 g) of melamine was first dissolved in 80 mL of deionized water at 80 °C, and stirred for 1 h with a speed of 400 rpm. 
2. Then, the transparent solution was transferred to a 100 mL stainless steel reactor and heated at 180 °C for 24 h. 
3. After the solution was cooled down, the white precipitate was collected and washed with deionized water three times. 
4. Then, the precipitate was freeze-dried for 12 h. 
5. Finally, the white sediment was heated in a tube furnace under argon to 500 °C at 5 °C min-1 ramp for 1.5 h.  

After the preparation of support carbon nitride nanotubes (CNNT), the catalyst is synthesized as followed:
1. 100 mg CNNT was first dispersed in 5 mL of Al(NO3)3 (4.2 mg) aqueous solution under ultrasonication for 10 min, followed by its frozen in liquid nitrogen. 
2. After being freeze-dried, the product was heated in a tube furnace under argon to 300 °C at 5 °C min-1 ramp for 1.5 h.
