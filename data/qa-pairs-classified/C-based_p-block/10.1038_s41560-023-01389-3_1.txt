question
Preparation of single-Sn atom supported on carbon matrix

answer
The catalyst is prepared by impregnation with support 3D carbon

The support 3D carbon is prepared as followed:
1. HY zeolite was first heated to 600 °C under a dry N2 flow in a fused quartz reactor. 
2. Then, a mixture of ethylene gas and N2 (volume ratio = 50:50) was passed through a water bubbler and fed into the zeolite bed at 600 °C for 30 min. 
3. The gas flow was switched to dry N2 when carbon deposition was completed. 
4. Afterwards, the temperature was increased to 950 °C and maintained there for 2 h. 
5. The resulting product was washed in a 0.5 M HF/0.2 M HCl solution to release carbon from the template. 
6. Finally, the as-prepared 3D carbon was dried in a vacuum oven for 24 h at 60 °C for further utilization.  

After 3D carbon is prepared, the catalyst is synthesized as followed:
1. 2 mmol SnBr2 and 2 mmol thiourea were added into a mixed solution containing 20 ml of oleic acid and 2.5 ml of oleyamine under magnetic stirring at 80 °C for 8 h (SnS2 precursor solution). 
2. Meanwhile, 20 mg 3D carbon was dispersed into10 ml of isopropanol under magnetic stirring at room temperature, followed by addition into the SnS2 precursor solution under magnetic stirring at room temperature for 2 h. 
3. Then, the obtained solution was transferred to a 100 ml Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave to perform solvothermal reaction at 200 °C for 20 h. 
4. After cooling down to room temperature, the solid product was washed with ethanol and deionized water, collected by centrifugation and dried in a vacuum oven for 24 h at 40 °C for further utilization
5. The product was successively leached at 80 °C in 2 M HCl for 24 h to remove SnS2 nanosheets and unstable species (Sn1-O3G).
