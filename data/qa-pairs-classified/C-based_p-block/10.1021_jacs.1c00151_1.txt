question
Synthesis of single atom In doped by N supported on carbon 

answer
the catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with precursor In-MOF

The In-MOF precursor is prepared as followed:
1. H3BTC (750 mg) and In(NO3)3·5H2O (150 mg) were added in a solution of DMF (48  mL) and MeOH (12 mL) at room temperature. 
2. The transparent mixture was transfered into the reactor after the powder was dissolved. 
3. Then the reactor was sealed and heated to 120 oC for 24 h. 
4. The as-obtained precipitates were centrifuged and washed with methanol for several times and dried in vacuum at 60 oC overnight.  

the synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. The 100 mg In-MOF precursor and 300 mg dicyandiamide in two porcelain boats were placed at two separate positions in a big porcelain boat covered by a lid. 
2. Then the porcelain boat was transferred to the tube furnace and heated to 1000 °C (heating rate 2 °C min-1) for 3 h in a stream of Ar (10 sccm)
