question
Synthesis of single atom Au supported on RP, denoted by Au1/RP

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor HAuCl4 and support Red Phosphorus (RP) 

The Red Phosphorus (RP) is prepared as followed:
1. 1.5 g of commercial red P and 20 mL of ultrapure water was mixed and transferred to a 25 mL hydrothermal reactor. 
2. After the hydrothermal reaction 200 oC for 16 hours, the samples in the reactor are washed with ultrapure water and ethanol. 
3. Subsequently, the sample was dried in a vacuum oven at 80 oC overnight.  

The catalyst is synthesized after preparation of RP:
1. RP (200 mg) and HAuCl4 (Mass percentage of Au: 0.1%, 0.5%, and 1%) were added with  25 mL methanol. 
2. Then, the mixture was sonicated for 30 minutes, then stirred at 300 rpm for 5 hours, and died by a freeze-drying process. 
3. The obtained solid sample was calcined in a tube furnace at 125 °C for 2 hours under an H2 atmosphere (2 mL/min),  and this sample is referred to as Au/RP.
