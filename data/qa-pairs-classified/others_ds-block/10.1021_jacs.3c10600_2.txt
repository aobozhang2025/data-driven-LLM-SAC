question
Synthesis of single atom Cu supported on Ni-BTP, denoted by Cu1Ni-BTP

answer
The catalyst is synthesized with the following procedures:
1. 195 mg of Ni(AcO)2·4H2O, 25 mg of Cu(AcO)2·H2O, 30 mg of PVP and 165 mg of H3BTP were successively added into 20 mL of DMF. 
2. The mixture was ultrasonicated for 0.5 h, then sealed in a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and stirred for 20 h at 160 °C. 
3. Upon cooling, the solid was collected by filtration and suspended in 50 mL of methanol for two days.  
4. The MOFs were then centrifuged and washed with ethanol/diethyl ether mixture, and finally dried in vacuum oven for 12 h to obtain the product.
