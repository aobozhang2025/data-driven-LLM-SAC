question
synthesis of single atom Cu supported on CdS

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor Cu(NO3)2 and support CdS nanorods.

The support CdS nanorods are prepared as followed:
1. Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (2 mmol) and thiourea (8 mmol) were dissolved in 20 mL of anhydrous ethylenediamine in a 50 mL breaker and magnetically stirred until the solids dissolved completely at room temperature. 
2. Then, the mixture was transferred to a 50 mL stainless Teflon-lined autoclave, tightly sealed, and placed in a 160 °C oven for 20 h. 
3. The system was then naturally cooled to room temperature. 
4. After being washed with deionized water (3 × 25 mL) and absolute ethanol (3 × 25 mL), a yellow solid was obtained after being dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 12 h. 

After the support CdS nanorods are prepared, the catalyst is synthesized as followed:
1. a certain amount of Cu(NO3)2 aqueous solution (11.1 mM) was added to a suspension of CdS (50 mg) dispersed in deionized water (50 mL).
2. Then, the mixture was stirred for 24 h in the dark at room temperature and atmosphere. 
3. The resulting yellow slurry was slightly dark compared with pure CdS nanorods. 
4. After being washed with deionized water (3 × 25 mL) and absolute ethanol (3 × 25 mL), Cd(Cu)S catalysts were obtained after being dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 12 h.
