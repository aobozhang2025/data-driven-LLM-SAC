question
synthesis of single atom Pb supported on Cu

answer
The catalyst is prepared by impregnation with metal precursor Pb(NO3)2

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. First, 515 mg CuCl2·2H2O and 115 mg Pb(NO3)2 were dissolved in 2 ml isopropanol in a vial. 
2. Under bath sonication, 2 ml propylene oxide and 0.2 ml H2O were then successively added, forming a green gel. 
3. The green gel was aged for 1 day and dried at 60 °C under vacuum overnight. 
4. The Pb1Cu SAA catalyst was then formed in situ by reducing the Cu–Pb precursor at a constant current density of −500 mA cm−2 for 30 min in a standard three-electrode flow cell system supplied with CO2 gas, with 0.5 M KHCO3 as electrolyte.
