question
synthesis of single atom Au doped by Na and OH supported on TiO2

answer
The catatyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor Au(OH)3 and support TiO2

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. Gold loadings of 0.5% were prepared by a single-step IWI of the designed amount of the gold solution. 
2. To prepare the solution, the proper amount of Au(OH)3 powder was suspended in 30 ml of H2O with O2 sparging and heated to 80 °C. 
3. NaOH powder (atomic ratio of Au:Na = 1:9) was added into the slurry at the same temperature. 
4. The mixture was refluxed at 80 °C overnight to obtain a transparent solution (colourless at lower concentrations to light yellow at higher concentrations). 
5. The solution was concentrated by heating followed by drying at 200 °C with N2 protection
6. and then the sample was further dried in vacuum overnight at 80 °C.
