question
Synthesis of single atom Cu supported on SiO2

answer
The catalyst is prepared by impregnation with metal precursor Cu(NO3)2 and support SiO2 nanopowder

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. 200 μL of Cu(NO3)2 solution (Cu content of 12.5 mg/mL) was added into10 mL ammonia solution (concentration of 5 mol/L) to form Cu(NH3)42+ solution. 
2. Then, 500 mg SiO2 nanopowder was added to the above solution and stirred at room temperature for one hour. 
3. The mixture was filtered and washed with DI water to pH neutral. 
4. Then the product was dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for 12 hours to obtain the Cu/SiO2 precursor. The theoretical Cu loading was 0.5 wt.%.
5. reducing the Cu/SiO2 precursor in 10 vol% H2/He for 1 h at 300 °C.
