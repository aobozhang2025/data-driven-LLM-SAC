question
Synthesis of single atom Cu supported on Al2O3, denoted by Cu/Al2O3. 

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and support Al2O3

The support Al2O3 is prepared as followed:
1. 4.28  g (11.4 mmol) of Al(NO3)3·9H2O was added into 100 mL deionized water at room temperature in a 250 mL flask. 
2. Then, 30 mL of Na2CO3 (2.71 g) solution was added dropwise into the solution under vigorous stirring and the mixture was stirred for a further 5 h at room temperature. 
3. The reaction  mixture was centrifuged and washed with water to remove the base until the pH value of the aqueous solution was≈7. 
4. Next, the solid was dried at 100 °C for 12 h, calcined at 350 °C for 5 h. 

After the preparation of Al2O3, the catalyst is synthesized as followed:
1. 0.15 g (0.6 mmol) of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and 0.60 g Al2O3 were added into 100 mL deionized water at room temperature in a 250 mL flask. 
2. Next, 10 mL of NaBH4 solution (0.023 g) was added dropwise into the solution. 
3. After 10 minutes, 20 mL of Na2CO3 (0.076 g) solution was added dropwise into the solution under vigorous stirring and the mixture (pH≈13) was stirred for a further 5 h at room temperature. 
4. The reaction mixture was centrifuged and washed with water to remove the base until the pH value of the aqueous solution was≈7. 
5. Next, the solid was dried at 100 °C for 12 h, calcined at 350 °C for 5 h, and then reduced under hydrogen flow at 350 °C for 3 h.
