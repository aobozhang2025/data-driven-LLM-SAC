question
preparation of single atom Cu supported on ZSM-5

answer
The catalyst is prepared by impregnation with metal precursor CuSO4·5H2O and support ZSM-5

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. 1 g of ZSM-5 was dispersed in 50 ml of ethanol by magnetic stirring. 
2. Subsequently, 10 mg of CuSO4·5H2O (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent) was ultrasonically dissolved in 50 ml of deionized water, and this solution was added into the ZSM-5 suspension. 
3. After vigorous stirring for 12 h, CuZSM SA was successfully obtained. 
4. The obtained products were thoroughly washed with deionized water and ethanol, followed by centrifugation. 
5. Subsequently, they were dried in an oven at 60 °C to remove any residual solvents, resulting in the final CuZSM SA product. 
6. The dried product was meticulously ground into a fine powder for further use. 
7. Subsequently, the porcelain boat-containing CuZSM SA was gradually heated to 550 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 in a 5% H2/Ar atmosphere. 
8. The sample was maintained at this temperature for 6 h to ensure complete reduction. 
9. natural cooling to room temperature
