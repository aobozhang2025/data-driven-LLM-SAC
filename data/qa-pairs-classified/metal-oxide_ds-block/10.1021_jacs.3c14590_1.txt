question
Preparation of the single atom Cu supported on TiO2/BiVO4, denoted by Cu1-TiO2/BiVO4

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation .

The support TiO2/BiVO4 is prepared as followed:
1. Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (1 mmol) was dissolved in ultrapure water (40 mL) and stirred for 10 min to form solution A. 
2. NH4VO3 (1 mmol) and urea (20 mmol) were dissolved in ultrapure water (32 mL) and stirred for 10 min to form solution B. 
3. Solution A was then added dropwise to solution B, followed by a certain amount of TiO2 (X mmol) and  further stirring for 60 min to form a suspension. 
4. Next, the suspension was transferred to a hydrothermal reactor (HTG-100-SS1, Anhui Kemi Machinery Technology Co., Ltd),  and heated at 90 °C for 12 h. 
5. Subsequently, it was naturally cooled to room temperature, centrifuged to obtain a solid precipitate, which was then washed with  deionized water, and dried at 60 °C overnight. 
6.Finally, the solid powder was reduced at 400 °C for 2 h in a H2 atmosphere to obtain a heterojunction catalyst TiO2/BiVO4

After the support TiO2/BiVO4 is prepared, the catalyst is synthesized with the following procedures:
1. 0.15g of TiO2/BiVO4 was dispersed in an aqueous solution (150 mL) and stirred  continuously for 0.5 h. 
2. Then Cu (0.5 wt %) solution was added dropwise. 
3. After that the  suspension was quickly frozen into blocks with liquid nitrogen, and illuminated with a  300 W Xe lamp (CEL-HXF300, Beijing Zhongjiao Jinyuan Technology Co., Ltd.) for 5   min. 
4. Subsequently, it naturally melted at room temperature, and the obtained  suspension was centrifuged and washed with ultrapure water for 3 times. 
5. Finally, the precipitate obtained was dried at 60 °C overnight
