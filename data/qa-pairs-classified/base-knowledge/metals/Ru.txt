question
chemical properties of Ruthenium (Ru)

answer
At the heart of ruthenium's catalytic prowess is its electron configuration: [Kr] 4d⁷5s¹. This configuration, with a half-filled s-orbital and a nearly half-filled d-orbital, contributes to its ability to readily form bonds with adsorbates and facilitate electron transfer during catalytic cycles.

Ruthenium's most common oxidation states in catalytic applications are **+2, +3, and +4**, although it can exhibit a wide range from -2 to +8. This flexibility allows a single ruthenium atom to participate in diverse reaction mechanisms, including redox reactions where the oxidation state of the metal center changes.

question
chemical properties of Ruthenium(III) chloride (RuCl3) 

answer
A widely used and cost-effective Ru precursor. It is often used in aqueous or alcoholic solutions for impregnation onto various supports. 

question
chemical properties of Ruthenium(III) acetylacetonate (Ru(acac)3)

answer
An organometallic complex Ru precursor that is soluble in organic solvents, making it suitable for synthesis methods requiring non-aqueous media. The acetylacetonate ligands can be removed by thermal treatment. 

question
chemical properties of Triruthenium dodecacarbonyl (Ru3(CO)12) 

answer
A metal carbonyl cluster that can be deposited onto supports and then thermally decomposed to yield well-dispersed ruthenium atoms or small clusters. The carbonyl ligands are readily removed.

question
chemical properties of Hexammineruthenium(III) chloride (Ru(NH3)6Cl3)

answer
A coordination complex as Ru precursor that provides a stable source of ruthenium(III) ions. The ammine ligands can be removed through calcination.
