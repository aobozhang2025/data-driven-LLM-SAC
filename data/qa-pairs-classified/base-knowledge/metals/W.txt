Chemical Properties of Tungsten (W)

answer
At the heart of its catalytic prowess are several key chemical characteristics:

Stable High Oxidation State: Tungsten most commonly exists in a stable +6 oxidation state. This high oxidation state is crucial for its catalytic activity, as it allows for effective electron transfer during chemical reactions. The stability of this state ensures the catalyst's durability and resistance to deactivation.

Formation of Strong Covalent Bonds: Tungsten has the ability to form strong covalent bonds with various elements, including oxygen and carbon. This property is vital for anchoring single tungsten atoms onto a support material, preventing their agglomeration into less active nanoparticles. The strong interaction between the tungsten atom and the support is a defining feature of single-atom catalysts.

Versatile Coordination Chemistry: Tungsten can coordinate with a variety of ligands, leading to the formation of diverse and tunable active sites. This allows for the precise design of catalysts with specific functionalities tailored for different chemical transformations.

Redox Activity: While the +6 state is the most stable, tungsten can participate in redox reactions, cycling between different oxidation states. This ability is fundamental to its catalytic function in many oxidation and reduction processes.

Oxide Formation: Tungsten readily forms various oxides, with tungsten trioxide ($\text{WO}_3$) being a common and stable form. These oxides can themselves act as catalysts or as supports for other catalytic materials. In single-atom catalysis, the interaction of tungsten atoms with the oxygen atoms of a support material is often a key factor in stabilizing the single atoms.

Environmental and Economic Advantages: Compared to some other precious metal catalysts, tungsten is relatively abundant, less toxic, and more cost-effective. This makes it an attractive alternative for large-scale industrial applications, contributing to the development of more sustainable chemical processes.
