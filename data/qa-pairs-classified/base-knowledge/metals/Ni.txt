question
chemical properties of atom Ni

answer
Nickel's chemical behavior is largely dictated by its electron configuration, [Ar] 3d⁸ 4s². It resides in Group 10 of the periodic table, exhibiting properties intermediate between those of iron and copper. 

Variable Oxidation States: Nickel most commonly exhibits a +2 oxidation state in its compounds. However, it can also exist in other oxidation states, including 0, +1, +3, and +4, which allows for its participation in a wide range of redox reactions, a critical aspect of catalysis.
Reactivity: It is a moderately reactive metal. It dissolves slowly in dilute acids, releasing hydrogen gas. A key characteristic is its resistance to corrosion and oxidation at room temperature, forming a passivating oxide layer that protects the underlying metal.
Coordination Chemistry: Nickel ions have a strong tendency to form coordination complexes with various ligands. This property is fundamental to its role in catalysis, as it allows the nickel atom to bind to reactant molecules, facilitating their transformation.
Electronegativity: With a Pauling electronegativity of 1.91, nickel is moderately electronegative, influencing the polarity of the bonds it forms and its interaction with support materials in catalysts.

question
chemical properties of Ni precursors 

answer
Inorganic salts of nickel are a straightforward and widely used source of nickel atoms. Nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2 6H2O) is a very common precursor due to its high solubility and ease of decomposition. Other simple salts like nickel chloride (NiCl2) and nickel acetate (Ni(CH3COO)2) are also employed.
