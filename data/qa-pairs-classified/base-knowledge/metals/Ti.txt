question
chemical properties of Titanium (Ti)

answer
At its core, the chemical behavior of a titanium atom is dictated by its electronic structure. With an atomic number of 22, its electron configuration is [Ar] 3d² 4s². This arrangement places it in the transition metals block of the periodic table, bestowing upon it several key characteristics relevant to catalysis:

Variable Oxidation States: Titanium most commonly exhibits oxidation states of +2, +3, and +4, with the +4 state being the most stable and prevalent in its compounds. This ability to readily change its oxidation state is crucial for catalytic cycles, where the metal center often needs to accept and donate electrons to facilitate chemical transformations.

Atomic and Ionic Radii: The atomic radius of titanium is approximately 147 picometers. In its common ionic forms, the radius shrinks, with Ti⁴⁺ being significantly smaller than Ti²⁺. This size factor influences how a single titanium atom can be anchored onto a support material and its accessibility to reactant molecules.

Reactivity and Oxophilicity: Titanium is a highly reactive metal with a strong affinity for oxygen, a property known as oxophilicity. This is why it readily forms a stable, passivating oxide layer (TiO₂) in the presence of air or moisture. This inherent reactivity is a double-edged sword; while it drives the formation of catalytically active sites, it also necessitates careful handling of titanium precursors, often under inert atmospheres.

question
chemical properties of Titanium Tetrachloride (TiCl₄)

answer
A workhorse in titanium chemistry, titanium tetrachloride is a colorless, fuming liquid at room temperature. Its key chemical properties as a precursor include:

High Reactivity and Lewis Acidity: TiCl₄ is a strong Lewis acid, readily accepting electron pairs from other molecules. This property facilitates its interaction with the surface of support materials, which often possess Lewis basic sites (e.g., oxygen atoms in metal oxides).
Volatility: With a boiling point of 136.4 °C, TiCl₄ is relatively volatile. This allows for its delivery in the gas phase, a common technique in catalyst preparation methods like atomic layer deposition (ALD), which offers precise control over the placement of single atoms.
Hydrolysis: Titanium tetrachloride reacts vigorously with water and moisture to produce titanium dioxide (TiO₂) and hydrochloric acid (HCl). This hydrolytic instability requires that syntheses using TiCl₄ be conducted under strictly anhydrous conditions to prevent the uncontrolled formation of titanium oxide nanoparticles instead of isolated single atoms.
