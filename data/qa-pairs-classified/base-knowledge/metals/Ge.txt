chemical properties of Germanium (Ge)

answer
Germanium (Ge), a metalloid element located in Group 14 of the periodic table, possesses a unique set of chemical properties that make it a promising candidate for applications in single-atom catalysis. With an atomic number of 32 and an electron configuration of [Ar] 3d¹⁰ 4s² 4p², germanium's intermediate nature between metals and nonmetals allows for versatile chemical interactions crucial for catalytic processes.

Germanium's position in the periodic table, nestled between silicon and tin, dictates its fundamental chemical behavior. It has four valence electrons, leading to common oxidation states of +4 and +2, with the +4 state being more stable. This flexibility in oxidation states is a key attribute for a catalyst, as it allows the atom to participate in redox reactions by mediating electron transfer.

The electronegativity of germanium is approximately 2.01 on the Pauling scale, indicating its ability to form covalent bonds with a variety of other elements. This property is essential for the anchoring of single germanium atoms onto a support material, a foundational aspect of single-atom catalysis. The stability of these bonds prevents the aggregation of individual atoms, maintaining the high efficiency and selectivity that are the hallmarks of this catalytic approach.
