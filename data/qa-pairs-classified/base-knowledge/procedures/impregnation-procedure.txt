question
how to prepare support in wet impregnation for SACs

answer
Drying: The support material (e.g., activated carbon, silica, alumina, MOFs) is typically pre-dried at elevated temperatures (e.g., 100–150 °C for 2–6 hours) to remove surface moisture that could affect precursor uptake.

Cooling: Allow the support to cool to room temperature in a desiccator or under inert atmosphere to avoid moisture absorption.

question
how to select container in wet impregnation for SACs

answer
Use an inert vessel (glass, Teflon, or quartz) like a beaker, round-bottom flask, or reactor with stirring capability.

The vessel should accommodate both the volume of the support and the metal precursor solution while allowing effective mixing.

the impregnation procedure of conventional wet impregnation

answer
Solution Preparation:
Dissolve the desired amount of metal precursor in a selected solvent (commonly water, ethanol, isopropanol, or a mixed solvent).
Adjust pH (if required) using acids or bases to ensure metal precursor solubility and support compatibility.

Impregnation:
Place the pre-treated support in the vessel.
Slowly add the metal precursor solution, typically dropwise or in small aliquots, to prevent local oversaturation.
Add an excess volume of solution relative to the total pore volume of the support.

Soaking and Contact Time:
Stir gently with a magnetic stirrer or overhead mechanical stirrer for uniform distribution.
Allow the suspension to stand or continue stirring for a few hours to overnight (6–24 h), depending on metal diffusion and support wettability.

Optional Treatments:
Ultrasonication: Can be applied during or after solution addition to improve infiltration into micropores.
Temperature Control: Some protocols involve gentle heating (e.g., 40–60 °C) to increase precursor mobility.

question
the impregnation procedure of Incipient Wetness Impregnation (IWI)

answer
Pore Volume Measurement:
Accurately determine the total pore volume of the support using techniques such as N₂ adsorption/desorption (BET method) or Hg porosimetry.
Example: For 1 g of support with a pore volume of 0.5 cm³/g, use exactly 0.5 mL of precursor solution.

Solution Preparation:
Prepare a highly concentrated precursor solution to achieve the desired metal loading within the limited volume.

Impregnation:
Place the dry support in a beaker.
Slowly add the precursor solution in small portions (dropwise or via micropipette) with continuous stirring.
Allow each addition to fully absorb before adding the next. Avoid forming a slurry or excess liquid phase.

Mixing:
Use a spatula or mechanical stirrer to mix thoroughly, ensuring uniform contact between the solution and the internal pore surface.
Alternatively, use vacuum-assisted impregnation to draw the solution into micropores.

Optional Aging:
Some protocols allow the impregnated support to "age" for 1–2 hours to improve metal-support interaction and redistribution before drying.

question
the drying procedure of wet impregnation

answer
After the impregnation step, the solution is evaporated to remove the solvent, typically under reduced pressure or using a rotary evaporator. This results in the precursor being left behind in the pores of the support material.

The drying process is important to avoid the aggregation of metal ions and to ensure a good dispersion of metal precursors on the support surface. The material is typically dried at 60-120°C.
