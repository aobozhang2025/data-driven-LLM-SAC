question
preparation of single atom Sn supported on CuO

answer
The catalyst is synthesized with the following procedures:
1. 65 mg of SnCl2·2H2O and 1.3 g of CuSO4·5H2O were added to 400 mL of deionized (DI) water in a 500 mL flask. 
2. Then the obtained solution was  precipitated by adding 20 mL of NaOH solution (1 mol L-1) under stirring and kept at 95 °C for 5 h.
3. Subsequently, the precipitate was collected by vacuum filtration and sufficiently washed several times  with DI water. 
4. Finally, the precipitate was dried in an oven overnight at 60 °C. The samples are denoted  Sn1-CuO
