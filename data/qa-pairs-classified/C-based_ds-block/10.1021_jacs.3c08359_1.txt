question
synthesis of single atom Cu supported on BIF-29, denoted by BIF-29(Cu)

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor Cu(NO3)2 and support Boron-Imidazolate Precursor (BIF-29)

The support BIF-29 is prepared as followed:
1. First, NaBH4 and Imidazole were both finely ground together using a mortar and pestle. 
2. The mixture was then transferred to a 100 mL round bottom flask and heated to 215 oC for three hours under constant flow Ar until hydrogen evolution ceased. 
3. The resulting solid mixture was collected and ground to a fine powder.  

After the support is prepared, the catalyst is synthesized by the following procedures:
1. dissolving Cu(NO3)2 (118 mg) and HB(Im)3 (46.5 mg) in a 3:2 Dimethylacetamide:MeOH (5 mL) solution. 
2. The mixture was then transferred to a 20 mL vial and reacted at 80 oC for three days. 
3. The resulting purple powder was transferred to a conical tube and diluted with MeOH before being centrifuged for five minutes. 
4. The supernatant was removed and replaced with methanol; this step was repeated five times. 
5. Then the washing solution was switched to acetone and repeated five more times. 
6. The resulting solid was then dried in a vacuum oven at 50 oC and then stored for further use as BIF-29(Cu)  
7. The 1 mg/mL MeOH dispersion solution was prepared by measuring 50 mg of the dried BIF-29(Cu) powder into a 100 mL media bottle, followed by the addition of approximately 50 mL MeOH. 
8. The bottle was sealed with electrical tape and then placed in an oven at 65 oC overnight. 
9. The resulting purple solution was then brought back to exactly 50 mL and stored for further use.
