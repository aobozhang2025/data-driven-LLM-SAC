question
Preparation of single atom Cu doped by N supported on C, denoted by Cu SAC/NC

answer
1. 0.5 mL NH4OH solution was mixed with 20 mL ethanol and 45 mL deionized water under ultrasound treatment for 10 min. 
2. Then 10.0 mL dopamine-HCl (200.0 mg) solution was injected. 
3. After that, 4 mg CuCl in 5 mL H2O was injected and stirred for 24 h. 
4. The product was obtained by centrifugation and washed with water for three times and dried at 60oC for 12 h. 
5. Finally, the obtained power was annealed in nitrogen atmosphere at 900 oC for 3 h with a heating rate of 5°C min-1. 
6. After cooling down to room temperature, Cu single atoms anchored in N-doped carbon (NC) can be obtained.
