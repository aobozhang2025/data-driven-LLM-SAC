question
preparation of single atom Au supported on KPCN, denoted by AuKPCN 

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor HAuCl4 and support KPCN

The support is prepared as followed:
1. melamine (4.0 g, Alfa Aesar) was ground with KBr (5.95 g, Alfa Aesar) in 3 ml ethanol (Et-OH) and 1 ml glycol in an agate mortar for 1 h.
2. After drying at 65 °C, the resultant mixture was heated to 560 °C for 4 h at a ramping rate of 2.2 °C min−1 in a tube furnace (inner diameter 4 cm) in N2 atmosphere (50 ml min−1). 
3. After cooling to room temperature, the bright yellow-green product was ball milled (400 rpm, 3 h) with ZrO2 balls of Ф ≈ 0.4 mm in Et-OH. 
4. The sample was washed by boiling deionized water several times, collected by filtration and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for 12 h. 

After the support is prepared, the catalyst is synthesized as followed:
1. a certain amount of KPCN was dispersed in 26 ml water under sonication for 60 min at 60 °C, followed by adding a certain amount of HAuCl4.
2. The mixture was then bubbled with N2 for 30 min (100 ml min−1). 
3. The reaction system was carefully sealed and then heated to 60 °C for 8 h. 
4. After cooling down to room temperature, the sample was washed by deionized water and Et-OH several times, collected by filtration and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for 12 h.
