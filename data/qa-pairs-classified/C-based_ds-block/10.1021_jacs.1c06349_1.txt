question
Synthesis of Cu coordinated with 4 C and support on hard carbon denoted by CuC4@HC

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor CuSO4∙5H2O

The precursor of Cu supported on a kind of MOF is first prepared as followed:
1. H2BDC (12 mmol, 1.994 g) and NaOH (25 mmol, 1.0 g) were  dissolved in 300 mL deionized water. 
2. After stirring for 30 min at room temperature, a 60 mL aqueous solution containing CuSO4∙5H2O (15 mmol, 3.75 g) was added dropwise to the above solution under vigorous stirring. 
3. After stirring for 5 h at room  temperature, the resulting blue precipitates were isolated by filtration, washed  thoroughly with water, and finally dried under vacuum at 70 °C for 24 h.  

After the Cu-MOF is prepared, the catalyst is synthesized as followed:
1. Cu-MOF was mixed with a certain amount of KCl-KBr salt (KCl: KBr = 1: 3 by weight, Cu-MOF: KCl-KBr salt = 1: 40). 
2. Then the mixture  was placed in a tubular furnace, which was heated to 730 °C at a ramp rate of 2 °C min-1  and kept for 180 min under Ar atmosphere. 
3. The obtained black powders were  thoroughly washed with deionized water, then immersed in aqua regia for 4 hours, and  finally washed with deionized water until neutral to obtain CuC4@HC.
