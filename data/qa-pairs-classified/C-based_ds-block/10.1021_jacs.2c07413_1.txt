question
Synthesis of Au single atoms supported on amorphous carbon nitride (ACN), denoted by Au1/ACN

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursors chloroauric acid (purchased from Jinke Reagent Co., Ltd., Shenyang, China, AR.) and support amorphous carbon nitride (ACN)

The support ACN is prepared by the following procedures:
1. 6.5 g urea (purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China,  AR.) was heated at 550 °C in a muffle furnace under static air atmosphere for 2 h, with the ramping rate of 8 °C/min, and then cooled down to room temperature and ground to get crystalline graphitic  carbon nitride (CCN). 
2. The CCN powder was heated at 620 °C for 2 h with a ramping rate of 5 °C /min under N2 atmosphere. 
3. Subsequently, the obtained solid powder was dispersed and sonicated in deionized water. 
4. The bottom precipitate was discarded, and the upper turbid liquid was suction filtered to obtain ACN. 
5. Finally, the as-obtained ACN was dried in a vacuum oven at 70 °C for 24 h.

After the synthesis of ACN, the catalyst is synthesized as followed:
1. 50 mg ACN was dispersed in 80 mL deionized water and sonicated for 2 h. 
2. Then 0.9  mL 1.0 mg/mL chloroauric acid (purchased from Jinke Reagent Co., Ltd., Shenyang, China, AR.) was added dropwise, followed by stirring at 60 °C for 10 h. 
3. The product was washed several times with ethanol and distilled water, and then dried in a vacuum oven at 50 °C for 8 h, followed by annealing  at 80 °C in a H2/Ar atmosphere for 8 h.
