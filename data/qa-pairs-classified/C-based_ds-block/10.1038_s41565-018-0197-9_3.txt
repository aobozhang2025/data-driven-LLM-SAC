question 
Preparation of Au single atoms supported on N-doped Carbon

answer
The catalyst is prepared in a framework of ZIF-8 synthesis

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. PVP (K30, 1.2 mmol in monomer unit) was added into an aqueous solution of HAuCl4·3H2O (1 mM, 30 ml) under ultrasound for 10 min. 
2. After stirring the mixture for 30 min at 0 °C by ice bath, we added an aqueous solution of NaBH4 (0.1 M, 3 ml) to the mixture under vigorous stirring and kept the temperature constant for another 30 min. 
3. After the reaction, 120 ml acetone was added and the dispersion was collected by centrifugation at 15,000 r.p.m. for 5 min. 
4. The obtained Au nanoparticles were washed with water several times and centrifuged by ultrafiltration centrifuge tube with a molecular weight cut-off membrane (MWCO = 10 kDa) at 10,000 r.p.m. for 5 min. 
5. Finally, the Au nanoparticles were dispersed in 6 ml methanol.  
6. 1,069 mg Zn(NO3)2·6H2O was dissolved in 15 ml methanol under ultrasound for 5 min to form a clear solution in flask A. 
7. Then 0.3 ml as-prepared Au nanoparticles dispersed in methanol solution (~1 mgAu ml–1) was added into flask A. 
8. 1,161 mg 2-methylimidazole was dissolved in 15 ml methanol under ultrasound for 5 min to form a clear solution in flask B. 
9. Then, we added flask B into flask A at room temperature and maintained the temperature for 12 h without stirring. 
10. The obtained product was collected by centrifugation at 15,000 r.p.m. for 5 min and washed with methanol for three times and finally dried at 70 °C for 5 h.  
1. We transferred Au nanoparticles supported on ZIF-8 powder into a ceramic boat and placed it in a tube furnace. 
2. The sample was heated to 1,000 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C min–1 and kept at 1,000 °C for 5 h under flowing nitrogen gas and then cooled to room temperature naturally.
