question
Synthesis of Cu single atom supported on Npyrr-C

answer
The catalyst is prepared by impregnation with metal precursor CuPc

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. 100 mg of CNT was dispersed in 100 mL of DMF under sonication for 1 h, followed by adding 5 mg of CuPc dispersed in DMF.
2. After 30 min of sonication, the mixture was stirred for 48 h at room temperature. 
3. The precipitate was then collected by vacuum filtration and sufficiently washed by DMF and ethanol until colorless. 
4. Finally, the precipitate was thermally treated at 300 °C for 2 h in a tubular furnace in argon atmosphere
