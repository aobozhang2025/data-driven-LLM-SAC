question
Synthesis of single atom Cu doped by N supported on carbon

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor Cu(NO3)2 and SiO2 template

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. 5.5 g 2,6-Diaminopyridine (DAP) and 27.87 g Ludox colloidal silica (SiO2) were firstly mixed in 400 mL H2O under vigorous stirring. 
2. Then 1.18 g NaOH was added into the solution above under agitation for 10 min. 
3. Next, 18.57 g/70 ml  (NH4)2S2O8 aqueous solution was quickly dropped into the resultant solution with successive stir for 12 h at ice bath for sufficient polymerization. 
4. The polymerized product was collected by filtration with water alternatively several times, and then dried in an oven 120 oC. 
5. Subsequently, the as-prepared N-C precursor was pyrolyzed at 800 oC for  2 h in NH3/He (V/V=1:1, 50mL/min) atmosphere with a ramping rate of 5 oC/min. 
6. Finally, the obtained black powder  was etched twice by 10 wt% HF (Caution: danger!!!) for 4 h to remove the SiO2 template and then dried under 80  oC overnight, denoted as N-C.  
7. a certain amount of Cu(NO3)·3H2O was first dissolved in 2 ml ethanol
8. 92 mg N-C powder was dispersed into another 25 ml ethanol under sonication. 
9. Cu(NO3)2  solution was added into N-C dispersion with vigorous agitation for 4 h at 60 oC. 
10. Afterwards, the mixed solution was filtered and washed repeatedly using ethanol to remove the superfluous Cu ion. 
11. The resulted sample was dried in an oven at 80 oC and then heat-treated at 140 oC with a heating rate of 2 oC under flowing NH3/He gas for 2 h to obtain the Cu-N-C SAC.
