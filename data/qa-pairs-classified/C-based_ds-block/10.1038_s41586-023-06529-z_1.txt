question
Synthesis of single atom Cu supported on PCN  

answer
The catalyst is prepared by impregnation with metal precursor CuCl2 and support exfoliated PCN

The preparation of support exfoliated PCN is prepared as followed:
1. Bulk PCN was prepared by calcining dicyandiamide at 550 °C (2.3 °C min−1 heating rate) in a crucible for 3 h in static air. 
2. thermal exfoliation at 500 °C (5 °C min −1 heating rate) for 5 h in static air. 
3. The exfoliation procedure was repeated several times until the PCN was exfoliated efficiently.  

After the preparation of support, the catalyst synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. CuCl2 (0.014 g) and exfoliated PCN (0.70 g) were dispersed in 200 ml for mamide, sonicated for 10 min and then stirred in an oil bath (120 °C) for 12 h, following centrifugation and washing thoroughly by ethanol several times.
2. The oven-dried powder (80 °C) was subsequently heated to 500 °C with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 and kept for 5 h with the protection of N2 flow.
