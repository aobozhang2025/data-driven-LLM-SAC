question
Preparation of single atom Cu supported on ZIF, denoted by CuSA/ZIF

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by a framework of ZIF synthesis:
1. 2-Methylimidazole was suspended in 15 mL of methanol as solution A. 
2. Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O were mixed and suspended in 15 mL of methanol as solution B. 
3. Solution A was then transferred dropwise into solution B with homogeneous stirring. 
4. The mixed solution was then vigorously stirred at room temperature for 24 h. 
5. After that, the mixture was centrifuged and washed with methanol three times and was further freeze-dried overnight. 
6. The resultant powder was then transferred into a quartz boat and placed in a saturated argon-filled gas tube furnace. 
7. Then, the powder was heated from room temperature to 800 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C·min−1 and further annealed at 800 °C for 3 h under an Ar flow. 
8. Thus, the final product was collected after being naturally cooled.
