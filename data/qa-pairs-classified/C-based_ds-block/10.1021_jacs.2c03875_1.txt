question
The preparation of single atom Cu doped by 3 N supported on carbon, denoted by Cu3N NC

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor Cu(NO3)2·3H2O

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. 10 mL octadecylamine (ODA) was added into the three-necked flask with vigorous stirring and heated to 250 °C until the color of the solvent turned orange, followed by quick addition of 0.3 g Cu(NO3)2·3H2O powder into the flask. 
2. Upon 15 min nucleation process, the Cu3N NCs were successful synthesized, evidenced by the change in color of solvent into luteotestaceous.
3. Next, the reaction mixture was cooled down to 70 °C, and the Cu3N NCs were firstly washed through a hot filter method with ethanol 4 times.
4. Then the oleosus precipitate was washed with cyclohexane and ethanol (1: 5) 2 times to remove the ODA. 
5. Finally, the Cu3N NCs were dispersed  into 5 mL cyclohexane.
