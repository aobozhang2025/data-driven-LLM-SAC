question
synthesis of single atom Zn supported on N-C, denoted by Zn1/NC

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursors zinc chloride 

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. 2.4 g chitosan powder was added into 200 mL deionized water with continuous magnetic stirring for 2 h at room temperature. 
2. Next, 4.8 g zinc chloride, dissolved in 50 mL deionized water, was added to the above solution. 
3. After the solution was stirred for 2 h, the solution was dried  at 80 °C under vigorously stirring. 
4. Afterwards, the as-obtained powder was placed in a tube furnace and heated to 750 °C for 2 h at the heating rate of 5 °C min-1 under N2 atmosphere. 
5. The calcined sample was washed several times with nitric acid and deionized water, and then vacuum dried and annealed at 900 °C
