question
Preparation of single atom Ag doped by S and N supported on carbon, denoted by Ag SAC/N-S-C  

answer
The synthesis in of this catalyst involves the preparation of CdS nanorods, CdS/Ag2S nanorods and CdS/Ag2S nanorods coated by 3-AF in sequence, single atom Au is loaded by impregnation with CdS/Ag2S as precursor. 

The procedures to synthesize CdS in nanorods are as followed:
1. 4.50 g sodium diethyldithiocarbamate trihydrate and 2.28 g cadmium chloride were added to 20 mL deionized water and stirred for 10 min. 
2. The white products (denoted as cadmium  diethyldithiocarbamate (Cd(S2CNEt2)2)) were obtained via centrifugation at 11000 rpm for 1 min  and dried at 60°C under vacuum. 
3. Then 2.25 g Cd(S2CNEt2)2) and 70 mL of ethylenediamine were added to a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. 
4. After Cd(S2CNEt2)2) completely dissolved, the autoclave was maintained at 180oC for 24 h and cooled down to room temperature.  
5. A yellowish precipitate was washed with deionized water and ethanol three times and collected by centrifugation. 
6. After dried at 60°C in a vacuum for 12 h, the CdS nanorods were obtained. 

After the synthesis of CdS nanorods, the procedures to synthesize CdS combined with Ag2S in nanorods (denoted by CdS/Ag2S) are as followed:
1. 100 mg CdS nanorods were dispersed in a solution of 36 mL toluene and 14 mL methanol. 
2. After stirring at room temperature for 10 min, 1.5 mg AgNO3 in 2 mL methanol was injected. 
3. After another stirring for 10 min, the product CdS/Ag2S was obtained by repeated sonication and centrifugation with water and dried at 60°C in a vacuum for 6 h.  

After the synthesis of CdS/Ag2S, the procedures to synthesize CdS combined with PdS coated by 3-AF (denoted by CdS/Ag2S@3-AF) are as followed:
1. 150 mg 3-aminophenol (3-AP), formaldehyde solution (100μL, 37 wt %), and CdS/Ag2S (100  mg) were dispersed in 50 mL ethanol/water solution (v/v 1:1) with ethanediamine (100 μL, 5  mg/mL) as catalyst. 
2. After that, the solution was stirred at room temperature for 24 h. 
3. Finally, the obtained CdS/Ag2S@3-AF was collected and purified with distilled water by centrifugation and  dried at 60°C in a vacuum for 6 h.  

After the CdS/Ag2S@3-AF are prepared, the procedures to synthesize the catalyst are as followed:
1. The CdS/Ag2S@3-AF powder was transferred into a ceramic boat and placed in a tube furnace. 
2. The sample was annealed at 900 °C for 3 h under N2 atmosphere with a heating rate of 5°C min-1. 
3. After cooling down to room temperature, Ag SAC/S-N can be obtained.
