question
Synthesis of single atom Co supported on ZIF oxidized

answer
The catalyst is prepared by impregnation with metal precursor CoCl2·6H2O and support ZIF

The catalyst is prepared as followed:
1. ZIF-8 (Basolite Z1200 from Sigma-Aldrich) powder (1 g) was annealed at 900 °C for 3 h under an Ar atmosphere (yield ~0.32 g) in a tube furnace to obtain ZIF-derived carbon. 
2. The ZIF-derived carbon (200 mg) was dispersed in 50 ml water and sonicated for 30 min. 
3. Cobalt acetate (177 mg) and 1,10-phenanthroline (594.6 mg) were dissolved in 15 ml of water. 
4. Then, 1 ml of this solution was added to the ZIF-derived carbon solution and the mixture was sonicated for another 30 min, followed by stirring for 24 h. 
5. After this, the powder was collected by filtration and was dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C overnight. 
6. The dried powder was annealed at 900 °C for 2 h under an Ar atmosphere to produce Co1–ZIF. 
7. The Co1–ZIF catalyst (200 mg) was dispersed in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution (300 ml) and heated up to 90 °C. 
8. After 3 h, 30% H2O2 solution (30 ml was added gradually to the above solution and reacted for 12 h. 
9. The resulting powder was filtered and rinsed with deionized water, and dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C
