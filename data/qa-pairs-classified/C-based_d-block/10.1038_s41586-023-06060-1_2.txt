question
synthesis of single atom Ni supported on N, S-doped carbon

answer
The catalyst is prepared by impregnation with metal precursor NiCl2·6H2O and template SiO2 nanoparticles

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. First, 1.0 g of o-phenylenediamine, 0.405 g NiCl2·6H2O and 1.0 g SiO2 nanoparticles (10–20 nm, Aldrich) templates were mixed together by using 20 ml 1.0 M HCl solution. 
2. Then, the mixed solution was sonicated for 0.5 h and stirred for another 0.5 h. 
3. Subsequently, 12 ml of 1.0 M HCl solution, which contains 3.0 g of ammonium peroxydisulfate, that is, (NH4)2S2O8, was added dropwise into the above mixed solution with vigorous stirring. 
4. After polymerization in an ice bath for nearly one day, the mixture was dried using a rotary evaporator. 
5. Then, the dried powder was annealed under Ar atmosphere at 800 °C for 2 h. 
6. Finally, the product was treated by alkaline (2.0 M NaOH) and acid (2.0 M H2SO4) leaching successively to remove SiO2 nanoparticles templates and unstable Ni-based species, respectively
