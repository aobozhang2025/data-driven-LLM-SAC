question
synthesis of single atom Fe supported on N-doped graphic layers

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor Fe(OAc)2 and template nano-MgO

The synthesis procedures are as followed
1. A mixture of Fe(OAc)2 (0.5 mmol, 87 mg) and 1,10-phenanthroline monohydrate (1.5 mmol,  297 mg) was added to 50 mL ethanol and sonicated for 10 minutes, followed by the addition of  3.16 g nano-MgO and then sonicated for another 10 minutes. 
2. Then the mixture was stirred at 60 oC overnight under reflux. 
3. Subsequently, the ethanol was removed under vacuum. 
4. The remaining solid was dried at 60 oC for 12 h and then transferred to a quartz boat in the tube furnace under an argon atmosphere. 
5. The tube furnace was heated to 800 oC at a rate of 2 oC  /min and was held at 800 oC for 2 h, the entire procedure was conducted under argon protection.  
6. The obtained black solid was stirred in 100 mL of 1M HNO3 solution at room temperature for 2 h. 
7. This process was repeated for three times to remove the MgO support. 
8. The recovered solid  was washed with water until the pH of the filtrate became neutral and then dried at 60 oC overnight.
