question
Synthesis of single atom Fe doped by N supported on Carbon

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by a framework of ZIF-8 synthesis

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. 1.190 g Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.141 g Fe(acac)3 were added to 30 mL methanol to form solution A. 
2. Meanwhile, 1.314 g 2-MeIM was added into 15 mL methanol to form solution B. 
3. Then, solution B was added into solution A under vigorous stirring, and the mixture was kept under continuous stirring for 16 h at room  temperature. 
4. After that, the mixture with precipitates generated inside was centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 3.0 min. 
5. The obtained precipitates were then washed with DMF and  methanol for three times, respectively, and further dried at 70°C overnight. 
6. After that,  the ZIF-8@Fe(acac)3 precursor was obtained 
7. The ZIF-8@Fe(acac)3 precursor was then transferred into a ceramic boat. The  ceramic boat was placed in the center of a horizontal quartz tube which was installed in  a furnace in advance. 
8. Under continuous argon gas of 200 mL min−1 in the quartz tube,  the furnace was heated to 900°C with a heating rate of 5°C min−1 and kept at 900°C for 3.0 h.
