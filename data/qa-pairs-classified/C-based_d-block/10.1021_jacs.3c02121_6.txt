question
Synthesis of single atom Ru supported on active carbon, denoted by Ru1/AC  

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor RuCl3 and support active carbon.

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. 30 mL RuCl3 aqueous solution (0.0335 mg mL-1, calculated as Ru) was added dropwise into 1 g of AC support. 
2. The mixture was continuously stirred and slowly evaporated at 60 °C.  
3. After that, the sample was transferred to an oven and dried at 110 °C overnight. 
4. The dried solid was then reduced in a tubular furnace at 300 °C for 1 h under 10% H2/Ar atmosphere.
