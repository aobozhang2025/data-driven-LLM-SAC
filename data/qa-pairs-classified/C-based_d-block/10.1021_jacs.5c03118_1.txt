question
Synthesis of single atom Ni supported on N and O doped hollow carbon

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor nickel nitrate hydrate and temlate silica nanoparticles

The template Silica nanoparticles are prepared as followed:
1. a solution containing 100 mL of ammonia, 350 mL of ethanol, and 150 mL of deionized (DI) water was stirred at room temperature (700 rpm) for 30 min. 
2. Thereafter, 50 mL of TEOS was added to the abovementioned solution and stirred (700 rpm) for 3 h. 
3. After the reaction, the stirred solution was centrifuged (7000 rpm, 10 min) and washed with IPA three times. 
4. The silica nanoparticles were dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 24 h.

After the preparation of template Silica nanoparticles, the catalyst is synthesized as followed:
1. dopamine (250 mg) was dissolved in 3 mL of ethanol and 6 mL of DI water under stirring at 700 rpm. 
2. Subsequently, a nickel nitrate hydrate (0.5 mmol) aqueous solution was added to the solution. 
3. Afterward, 3 mL of a THF solution containing PS-b-PEO was added dropwise to the resulting solution. 
4. Next, 25 mL of a DI water solution containing 250 mg of silica nanoparticles and 30 mg of tris buffer were added to this solution under stirring.
5. After 20 h of reaction , the product was washed with DI water three times, collected through centrifugation (8000 rpm, 10 min), and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C. 
6. The obtained powder was placed in a quartz boat and heated under a flow of nitrogen gas. 
7. The temperature was increased  from 25 to 100 °C at a rate of 2 °C min−1 and maintained at 100 °C for 2 h. 
8. The temperature was also increased to 800 °C at a rate of 2  °C min−1 and maintained at 800 °C for 3 h. 
9. The obtained black powder was further treated with a 4 M NaOH solution at 50 °C for 20 h under stirring to remove the silica template. 
10. It was then washed with DI water until its pH reached 7 and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C.
