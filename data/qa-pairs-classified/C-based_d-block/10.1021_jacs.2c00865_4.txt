question
preparation of Ni doped by N supported on Carbon, denoted by Ni-N-C

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor NiCl2·6H2O

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. 4.3875 g NaCl, 416 mg glucose and 0.03 mmol NiCl2·6H2O were added into 25 mL DI and stirred for 1 h to ensure the homogeneous state of the solution. 
2. The obtained mixture was freeze-dried for 48 h and then ground by agate mortar to form fine powder.  
3. The powder was put in the middle of the tube furnace and flushed with argon gas (Ar) for at least 30 min to eliminate air thoroughly. 
4. The tube furnace was heated at 500 °C with the ramp rate of  5 °C/min and kept for 4 hours under the ammonia gas (NH3) atmosphere (the flow rate of NH3 was  50 sccm). 
5. Dissolve the calcination powder in 2000 mL water and stir overnight to remove NaCl template completely, then dried at 80 °C overnight. 
6. Calcining the black powder under 850 °C by  controlling the heating rate 5 °C/min for 4 hours under the protection of Ar
