question
synthesis of single site Ru supported on C

answer
The catatyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor Ru(iii) acetylacetonate and support activated carbon

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. Activated carbon was initially ground to obtain a powder (150–200 mesh). 
2. Ru(iii) acetylacetonate (Aldrich) was dissolved in the required solvent (2.7 ml). 
3. The solution was then added dropwise, with stirring, to the activated carbon (0.99 g) to obtain a catalyst with a final metal loading of 1 wt.%. 
4. The resulting powder was dried at a temperature 5–10 °C higher than the boiling point of the solvent used for 16 h under a flow of N2. 
5. Wherever possible, extra dry solvents sealed under nitrogen were used.
