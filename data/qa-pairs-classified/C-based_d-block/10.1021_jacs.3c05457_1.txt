question
Preparation of FePc supported on carbon nanotubes, denoted by FePc-CNT  

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation:

FePc is first prepared as followed:
1. Phthalic anhydride (1.18 g), urea (2.40 g), ammonium molybdate (23.68 mg), and iron chloride hexahydrate (648.05 mg) were mixed and ground evenly, and then placed into a round-bottom flask.  
2. The mixture was stirred at 140 oC until molten followed by adding ammonium chloride (246.05 mg) and sodium carbonate (478.56 mg), heating and stirring for 30 min. 
3. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was placed in a crucible and heated in a muffle furnace at 240 °C at a ramp rate of 5 °C  min-1 for 3 hours and then cooled down to room temperature. 
4. The resulting sample was boiled in 1 M hydrochloric acid, deionized water, 1 M sodium hydroxide for 30 min consecutively and then filtered  until the filtrate was colorless and neutral. 
5. Finally, the mixture was washed with DMF, ethanol and acetone successively until the filtrate was colorless, and then dried overnight in dark at 70 °C in a  vacuum oven. 

The catalyst is synthesized as followed:
1. CNT (100 mg) was dispersed in DMF (100 mL) under sonication for 30 min, followed by adding FePc (25 mg) and sonicated for another 30 min.
2. The resulting mixture was stirred for 2 days at room temperature.  
3. Subsequently, the precipitate was vacuum filtered and sequentially washed with DMF and ethanol until the filtrate was colorless. 
4. Finally, the product was collected by freeze-drying.
