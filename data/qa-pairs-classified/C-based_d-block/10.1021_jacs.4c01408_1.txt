question
synthesis of single atom Rh doped by P and N supported on carbon 

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by a framework of ZIF synthesis with metal precursor rhodium(III) chloride hydrate

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. 75 mL methanol solution of zinc nitrate hexahydrate (0.128 M) and 75 mL methanol solution of 2-methylimidazole (0.512 M) were mixed and stirred vigorously at room temperature for 5 min. 
2. Then, the resulting solution was transferred and sealed in a container, followed by heating to 35 °C for 6 h to improve the crystallinity of ZIF-8. 
3. The as-obtained ZIF-8  was washed thoroughly with methanol for several times and dried in vacuum at 80 °C. 
4. Subsequently,  800 mg ZIF-8 sample was dispersed in 40 mL methanol, and added into the 200 mL methanol solution with 640 mg of bis(4-aminophenyl) ether and 320 mg of phosphonitrilic chloride trimer  under continuous stirring. 
5. Then, 16 mL triethylamine and 100 mL methanol were mixed and slowly  dropped into the above suspension, following by heating to 40 °C for 14 h to prepare the ZIF-8 coating poly-(cyclotriphospazene-co-4,4'-diaminodiphenylether) (PZM) sample, which was marked  as ZIF-8@PZM. 
6. The as-obtained ZIF-8@PZM was annealed in N2 atmosphere at 950 °C for 3 h  (heating rate: 5° min-1). 
7. 200 mg of the ZIF-8@PZM was dispersed in 20 mL methanol, and 10 mL methanol solution of rhodium(III) chloride hydrate (1 mg/mL) was slowly dropped into the above suspension of ZIF-8@PZM under continuous stirring for more than 24 h, 
8. followed by washing by methanol, drying and  annealing in N2 atmosphere at 250 °C for 2 h (heating rate: 2° min-1).
