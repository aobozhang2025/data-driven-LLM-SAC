question
synthesis of single atom Fe supported on N-doped carbon

answer
The catalyst is prepared impregnation with metal precursor FeSO4·7H2O and support ZIF-8

The catalyst is prepared as followed:
1. 0.95 mM Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.05 mM FeSO4·7H2O as metal sources, and 8.21 g of 2-methylimidazole as the organic linker, were mixed with methanol to form Fe-doped ZIF-8. 
2. The excess organic linker and metal sources were removed by washing the product three times with absolute ethanol. 
3. After drying in a vacuum oven at 80 °C overnight, Fe-doped ZIF-8 precursor was directly heat-treated in Ar gas (99.99% purity) at 1,000 °C for 1 h to derive the final Fe–N–C catalyst. 
Atomically dispersed Fe atoms were uniformly distributed on the N–C framework without further acid washes. The weight of Fe loading in the final catalyst was around 2.0 wt%.
