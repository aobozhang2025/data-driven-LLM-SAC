question
Synthesis of single atom Ir supported on P-doped Carbon, denoted by Ir1/PC

answer
The catalyst is synthesized impregnation and freeze drying. 

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. 2 g of melamine, 2 g of cyanuric acid, 1 g of L-alanine, and 400 μL of phytic acid  (50 wt%) were dispersed in 100 mL of deionized (DI) water. 
2. After that, the suspension was strongly stirred at 100 oC to get a homogenous white polymeric precursors. 
3. In the meantime, 200 mg of IrCl3 was dissolved into 50 mL of DI water to prepare the IrCl3 stock solution with a concentration of 4 mg per milliliter. 
4. 2 mL of IrCl3 stock solution was slowly added into the above precursors under stirring for 12 h. 
5. The resultant slurry was quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. 
6. After freeze drying, the collected powder was pyrolyzed at 800 °C for 2 h under Ar gas to obtain the final sample without further treatment.
