question
synthesis of single atom Fe supported on N-doped Carbon

answer
The catalyst is prepared impregnation with metal precursor Fe(II)Cl2·4H2O

The catalyst is prepared as followed:
1. commercial ZIF-8 (Basolite Z1200, Sigma Aldrich) as a combined C and N precursor was pyrolysed in a tube furnace at 900 °C for 1 h under flowing nitrogen gas (research grade, BOC Ltd) to obtain a nitrogen-doped carbon framework that contained abundant Zn–Nx sites (Zn–NC). 
2. A heating rate of 3 K min−1 was used to reach the set temperature of 900 °C. 
3. The Zn–NC product was then leached by refluxing in a 2 M H2SO4 solution (95% H2SO4, Aristar, VWR) for 15–18 h to effectively remove most of the coordinated Zn (□-NC), although these sites are protonated. 
4. Leaching Zn–NC under aggressive acid reflux conditions was significantly more effective to remove Zn as compared with acid leaching at room temperature. 
5. In the second step, 100 mg of □-NC powder was dispersed in 100 ml of methanol (VWR) that contained 100 mg of Fe(II)Cl2·4H2O (99%, Honeywell Fluka). 
6. This mixture was refluxed for 15–18 h with constant stirring followed by thorough washing in de-ionized water and then overnight leaching in 0.5 M H2SO4 to ensure a complete removal of the physisorbed Fe ions. 
7. Afterwards, this iron-coordinated catalyst was subjected to a thorough aqueous washing and was then dried in a vacuum oven overnight at 70 °C. 
8. This unactivated catalyst, Fe–NCU, was then mixed with the DCDA (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) in a weight ratio of 2:1 and thoroughly ground for 15 min before it was subjected to the activation step at 900 °C for 1 h under a flow of a 5% H2/N2 gas mixture (BOC Ltd). 
9. The temperature ramping rate was 3 K min−1 and the sample was cooled down naturally to room temperature after activation to give final activated catalyst
