question
Synthesis of single atom Fe doped by 4 N supported on carbon

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation and freeze drying with metal precursor FePc

The support defective carbon is prepared as followed:
1. MgCO3·Mg(OH)2·5H2O as templates was heated to  900 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min-1 in a tubular furnace under N2 atmosphere.
2. Subsequently, the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) procedure was conducted  employing acetonitrile as carbon source. 
3. Acetonitrile was introduced into the tubular furnace via N2 stream, and the CVD reaction persisted for 3 h at 900 °C. 
4. The resultant sample underwent a purification step involving immersion in 6 M HCl for 24 h at ambient temperature. 
5. The purified sample was then subjected to filtration with  deionized water and subsequently dried in a blast oven for 24 h at 60 °C.  

After the preparation of support, the catalyst is synthesized as followed:
1. 100 mg of defective carbon and 25 mg of FePc were separately dispersed in 100 ml DMF. 
2. 30 min ultrasonication was applied for thorough materials dispersion. 
3. Subsequently, the two dispersions were combined and stirred vigorously for 24 h enabling sufficient interaction. 
4. The product was collected by filtration and freeze-drying. 
5. The obtained powder was loaded in a tubular furnace and subsequently sintered at 800 °C for 1 h under N2 atmosphere. 
6. Subsequently, the sintered  powder was purified in 3 M HCl solution. 
7. The sample was washed with deionized water  until neutral and dried, yielding Fe-N-C.
