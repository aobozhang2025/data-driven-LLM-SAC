question
synthesis of single site Pt supported on C

answer
The catatyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor Pt(ii) 2,4-pentanedionate and support activated carbon

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. Activated carbon was initially ground to obtain a powder (150–200 mesh). 
2. Pt(ii) 2,4-pentanedionate (Alfa Aesar) was dissolved in the required solvent (2.7 ml). 
3. The solution was then added dropwise, with stirring, to the activated carbon (0.99 g) to obtain a catalyst with a final metal loading of 1 wt.%. 
4. The resulting powder was dried at a temperature 5–10 °C higher than the boiling point of the solvent used for 16 h under a flow of N2. 
5. Wherever possible, extra dry solvents sealed under nitrogen were used.
