question
Synthesis of single atom Fe doped by N and O supported on carbon

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor FeCl2·4H2O

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. 2.5 mmol of FeCl2·4H2O (498 mg), and 1 g of 1,10-phenanthroline (5.6 mmol) were added in 100  mL of EtOH. 
2. The mixture was then heated at 60 °C in an oil bath for 0.5 h. 
3. Then, magnesium hydroxide (10 g) was added to the above mixture, which was stirred for another 2 h at 60 °C. 
4. Next, the removal of ethanol was conducted by rotary evaporation at 60 °C to gain mixed solids. 
5. Afterward, the solids were dried for 10 h under vacuum and finely ground. 
6. At 700 °C, the powder was calcinated under a N2 atmosphere (5 °C/min) for 2 h to obtain a black solid. 
7. In the HNO3 solution (4 M), the black solid was stirred at room temperature (rt) overnight to remove residual metal nanoparticles and MgO. 
8. The obtained solid was washed with deionized (DI) water three times and ethanol one time, respectively. Finally, at 100 °C, the black solid was dried for 6 h.
