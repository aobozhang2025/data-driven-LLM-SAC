question
Synthesis of single atom Ni doped by N supported on C, denoted by Ni-NAC

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor Ni acetylacetonate and template SBA-15

The template SBA-15 is prepared as followed:
1. SBA-15 was obtained first for the template growth of Ni-NAC. 
2. Pluronic P123 (4 g) was first dissolved in 120 ml of hydrochloric solution (1.6 M) at 38 °C. 
3. After  being dissolved, 8.5 mL of TEOS was added, and the solution was stirred for 20 h. 
4. The composition of the achieved gel was 1 TEOS: 0.017 P123: 5.68 HCl: 197 H2O. 
5. The hydrothermal synthesis was performed in an oven at 100 °C for 24 h in a sealed polypropylene bottle. 
6. The white solid material was recovered by Büchner filtration, washed with distilled water, and dried overnight in an oven at 80 °C. 
7. The obtained solid was then calcined in a muffle furnace at 550 °C under air for 5 h with a heating rate of 1 °C min−1 to produce SBA-15.

After template SBA-15 is prepared, the catalyst is synthesized as followed: 
1. Ni acetylacetonate was added into a solution of ethylenediamine (1.80 g) and carbon tetrachloride (4.00 g), followed by the addition of SBA15 (0.80 g). 
2. The mixture was then heated in an oil bath set at 90 °C for 16 h for condensation before the oil bath temperature increased to 120 °C for 4 h to remove the uncondensed ethylenediamine and carbon tetrachloride. 
3. The obtained powders were calcined under Ar flow, with temperature increased in a ramping rate of 3 °C min−1 and further maintained at 800 °C for 2 h. 
4. The achieved black powder was then etched with 5 wt % HF solution to remove the SBA-15. 
5. The catalyst was recovered via centrifugation and washed with deionized water until the pH reached 7. 
6. The catalyst was further dried at 100 °C for future usage.
