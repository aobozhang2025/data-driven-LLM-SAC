question
synthesis of single atom Fe doped by N supported on carbon

answer
The catalyst is synthesized with metal precursor FeCl3 

The catalyst synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. 0.7 g of 1,2-dicyanobenzene and 16 mg of FeCl3 was mixed with 7 g of a 60 mol% LiCl/ZnCl2  mixture in a Ar-filled glovebox. 
2. The resulting powder was placed in an alumina crucible and heated  with a heating rate of 10 K/min to 800 °C in a tube furnace with a constant Ar flow. 
3. After 1 h at 800  °C, the sample was let to cool down to room temperature. 
4. The obtain material was ground, washed  with 0.1 M HCl for several hours and dried.
