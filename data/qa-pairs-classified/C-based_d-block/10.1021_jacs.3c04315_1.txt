question
Preparation of Fe doped by 4 N supported on Carbon 

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor FeCl3 and support N-doped carbon (NC)

The NC precursor is prepared as followed:
1. First, 2.0 g of KJ 600 and 60 mL of deionized water were mixed in a flask (500 mL) and ultrasonically treated in an ice bath for 2 h. The resulting dispersion was labeled A. 
2. Then, 1.48 g of p-aminobenzenesulfonic acid was dissolved in 60 mL of deionized water, followed by adding 18 mL of 1 M NaOH, 42 mL of 1 M HCl, and 8 mL of 1 M NaNO2 to prepare the diazo salt, labeled B, with the reaction temperature controlled at 0 °C. 
3. Then, B was poured into dispersion A. 
4. Then, the mixture was uniformly stirred, followed by adding 1.396 g of reduced iron powder to initiate the surface grafting of the diazonium salt. 
5. Then, 50 mL of concentrated HCl, 15.22 g of mPDA, 140 mL of 2 M (NH4)2S2O8, and 45 mL of 1 M FeCl3 solution were added to the prepared solution and left to react overnight. 
6. Finally, the NC precursor was obtained after filtering, washing with water thrice, and vacuum drying overnight. 

After the NC precursor is prepared, the catalyst is synthesized as followed: 
1. First, 1.2 g of the NC precursor was ultrasonically dispersed in 60 mL of deionized water, followed by adding 3.6 mL of 1 M FeCl3 and 12 mL of 1 M KSCN. 
2. Then, it was subjected to ultrasonic dispersion to form a homogeneous mixture. 
3. Then, the powder precursor was obtained by rotary evaporation to remove the solvent, followed by heat treatment at 950 °C under an Ar/CO2 atmosphere (5% CO2 in the volumetric fraction) for 1 h. 
4. Then, the obtained black powder was soaked in 100 mL of a 1 M HCl solution overnight at 80 °C in a water bath. 
5. After filtering, washing with water thrice, and drying overnight, the powder was heated at 950 °C for 3 h under the Ar atmosphere to obtain Fesac.
