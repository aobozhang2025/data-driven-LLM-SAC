question
Preparation of single atom Co supported on Carbon

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor Cobalt(II) acetate tetrahydrate and support carbon powder

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. Cobalt(II) acetate tetrahydrate (Sigma-Aldrich ≥ 98%, 124.5 mg, 0.5 mmol) and carbon powder (700.0 mg) (VULCAN® XC72R, Cabot Corporation Prod. Code XVC72R; CAS No. 1333-86-4) were stirred in ethanol (40 mL), and the resulting mixture was refluxed for 4 hours. 
2. After cooling down to room temperature and the removal of the ethanol solution by rotatory evaporation, the remained solid composite was dried at 80 °C under vacuum for 12 hours, which was then grinded to fine particles. 
3. The ground powder was then heated to 800 °C with a rate of 10 °C/min, and then pyrolyzed at 800 °C for 2 hours under argon atmosphere.
