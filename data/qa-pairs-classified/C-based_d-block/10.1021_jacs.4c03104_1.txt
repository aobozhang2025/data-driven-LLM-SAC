question
synthesis of single atom Fe supported on n-CNT

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor FeCl3•6H2O and support Nafion modified hydrophobic CNTs (n-CNTs)

The support is prepared with the following procedures：
1. 30 mg of carbon nanotubes (CNTs)  and 20 mL of ethanol were taken together into the beaker and sonicated for 30 min. 
2. Subsequently, 1.6 mL of  Nafion 117 polymer solution (5 wt.%) was added in the CNTs suspension and sonicated for another 30 min.  
3. Hereafter, the mixed solution was dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C overnight. 
4. Resultantly, the Nafion modified  hydrophobic CNTs (n-CNTs) sample has been collected as support for single metal atom immobilization. 

After the support is prepared, the catalyst is synthesized as followed:
1. First, 30 mg of n-CNTs and 20 mL  of deionized (DI) water (18.2 MΩ) was added into the beaker, sonicating for 15 min and vigorously stirring  for another 45 min, respectively. 
2. Then, 1.5 mL of FeCl3•6H2O (0.01M) solution was added dropwise into the  above solution, vigorously stirring for 12 hours at room temperature. 
3. After the ionic exchange process, the  sample was washed with DI water 5 times and collected via centrifugation. 
4. Finally, the washed sample was  dried in the vacuum oven at 60 °C overnight.
