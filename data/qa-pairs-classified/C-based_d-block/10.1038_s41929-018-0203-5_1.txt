Synthesis of single atom Co supported on P-doped carbon nitride

answer
It was synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor Co(NO3)2 for single atom Co and support precursor g-C3N4 for carbon nitride. 

The procedures are as followed:
1. 10 g of urea (SigmaAldrich, ≥99% purity) was heated to 600 °C for 2 h in a muffle furnace, and then naturally cooled to room temperature to obtain the flavescent powders as g-C3N4
2. The as prepared g-C3N4 was sufficiently mixed with NaH2PO2·H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99% purity, 5:1) by grinding for 30 min, and heated at 300 °C for 2 h (2 °C min−1) in an Ar atmosphere to obtain PCN. 
3. 200 mg PCN was dispersed in 60 ml deionized water with sonication and transformed in an oil bath. Co(NO3)2 (Sigma-Aldrich, ACS reagent, ≥98% purity) aqueous solution  (2 mg ml−1) was dropped into the PCN (aqueous) and stirred at 70 °C for 6 h.  
4. The mixture was then dried and placed in a tube furnace and annealed at 400 °C for 2 h in an Ar atmosphere. 
5. Finally, the obtained compounds were ultrasonicated, washed several times and dried under vacuum overnight.
