question
synthesis of single atom Fe doped by N supported on carbon

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by a framework of ZIF-8 synthesis.

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. 2.83 g of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.139 g of FeSO4·6H2O were dissolved in 1000 mL of methanol. 
2. 82 g of 2-methylimidazole was dissolved in another 1000 mL methanol. 
3. Then the two solutions were mixed and stirred vigorously for 24 h at room temperature to form Fe-ZIF8. 
4. After centrifugation and  washing with methanol, Fe-ZIF8 underwent pyrolysis at 1000 °C for 2 h under Ar atmosphere to collect Fe-N-C.
