question
Preparation of single atom Pt doped by Polyoxometalate supported on active carbon

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor Pt(acac)2 and support active carbon (AC)

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. in a 15 mL centrifuge tube containing 0.9 g of AC, an Polyoxometalate (Phosphomolybdic acid (H3PMo12O40, PMA), phosphotungstic acid (H3PW12O40, PTA), silicomolybdic acid (H4SiMo12O40, SMA), or tungstosilicic acid (H4SiW12O40, STA) ) solution (54 μmol, 100 mg in 10 mL acetone) was introduced dropwise and mixed with AC by vigorous stirring (800 rpm for 5 h) and sonication (5 min). 
2. Afterward, the sample was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 3 min and dried in an oven at 70 °C for 0.5 h. 
3. The same steps were applied for the loading of an equimolar amount of Pt(acac)2 (54 μmol, 0.017 g in 1 mL of acetone)  onto SMA-modified AC.
4. Finally, the dried sample was reduced in 5% H2/N2 (gas flow rate: 100 mL/min) at 160 °C for 1 h.
