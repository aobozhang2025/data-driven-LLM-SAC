question
Synthesis of single atom Y doped by S and N supported on Carbon, denoted by Y SAs/NC-S

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor Y(acac)3 and support ZIF-8

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. 1161 mg 2-methylimidazole was dissolved in 10 mL solution  (DMF/MeOH, 4:1) with stirring (solution A). 
2. 1069 mg Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 352 mg Y(acac)3 were dissolved in a mixture of DMF/MeOH (15 mL, 4:1) under ultrasound for 10 min to form a clear solution (solution B). 
3. Solution A was subsequently added into solution B with vigorous stirring and then was kept static for 12 h at room temperature. 
4. The obtained product was collected by centrifugation, and washed with methanol for three times, and finally dried at 60 °C under  vacuum.  
5. The powder of Y(acac)3@ZIF-8 was placed in a tube furnace and heated to 950 °C (heating  rate 2.5 °C/min) for 3 h under a flowing atmosphere of Ar
6. The product mixed with S (mass ratio: 1:2) was carefully ground by mortar and pestle, and then sealed in a quartz ampoule. 
7. The Y SAs/NC-S composites were then obtained from a heating process: heat at 155 °C for 12 h with a ramping rate of 1 °C min−1  and then at 300 °C for 10 min (heating rate 10 °C /min) under flowing Ar.
