question
synthesis of single atom Mn supported on carbon nanotubes, denoted by Mn-CNTs

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor MnPc

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. carbon nanotubes (CNTs) (100 mg) and a certain amount of MnPc powders were separately dispersed in DMF, and both solutions were ultrasonicated for 30 min. 
2. Then the MnPc DMF solution was added into the CNTs DMF solution dropwise under vigorous stirring. 
3. The mixed suspension was sonicated for another 30 min and further stirred for 24 h at room temperature in dark. 
4. Then the solid was separated via vacuum filtration, and washed with DMF for three times. 
5. Finally, the Mn-CNTs was obtained after lyophilization for 24 h.
