question
Synthesis of the Co doped by N supported on carbon

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor Co(OAc)2·4H2O

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. A 0.5 mmol portion of Co(OAc)2·4H2O (125 mg) was dissolved in 40 mL of ethanol. 
2. An ethanol solution (10 mL) of 1,10-phenanthroline (Phen, 1.0 mmol, 180 mg) was added dropwise, and the reaction mixture was sonicated for 30 min. 
3. Phen (90 mg) and Mg(OH)2 (4 g) were then added, and the reaction mixture was further sonicated for 30 min. The mixture was then refluxed at 60 °C for 4 h. 
4. The ethanol solvent was removed by rotary evaporation, and the remaining solids were dried overnight in air and finely ground. 
5. The powder was calcinated at 900 °C for 2 h under a nitrogen atmosphere (ramping rate: 2 °C/min). A black solid was obtained. 
6. It was stirred in a 1 M HNO3 solution at room temperature for 2 h to remove the MgO support. 
7. The solid was further washed with ultrapure water until the filtrate became neutral. The solid was dried in air at room temperature overnight.
