question
synthesis of Mn-pyridinic doped by 4 N supported on crumpled graphene

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor MnCl2 and support crumpled graphene.

The support crumpled graphene is prepared as followed:
1. 3 g graphite powder was dissolved in a mixture of 360 mL concentrated H2SO4 and 40 mL concentrated H3PO4 and stirred in an ice bath for 4 hours. 
2. Subsequently, 18 g of KMnO4 was slowly added at  room temperature for 1 hour. 
3. After 12 hours of stirring at 50 °C in an oil bath, the resulting  mixture was poured into 400 mL of deionized water (DI) containing 3 mL of H2O2.
4. The obtained GO mixture was further purified with HCl and DI water, yielding GO. 
5. Exfoliated GO is fabricated by ultrasonic dispersion of graphite oxide in DI water and followed by vacuum drying at 80 °C for 2 days. 
6. The concentration-controlled GO solution (5 mg mL-1)  was then spray-dried in a tube furnace preheated to 100 °C using an argon gas flow (10 L  min-1). 
7. The water in the sprayed graphene oxide droplets evaporates quickly as they fly in the chamber. 
8. Fast evaporation reduces the water droplets, compressing them into crumpled graphene oxide (CGO). 
9. The CGO powder was annealed in a quartz tube furnace at 1100 °C  for 2 hours in an argon gas atmosphere. 
10. After thermal annealing, the CGO was reduced to the desired material called crumpled graphene (CG).  

After the support is prepared, the catalyst is synthesized with the following procedures:
1. 1.38 ml of 0.6 M MnCl2 aqueous solution was incrementally added to a mixture comprising 200 ml of 0.5 M HCl solution and  2 ml of aniline, followed by stirring at 4°C for 1 hour. 
2. To initiate aniline polymerization, 20  ml of 1.1 M (NH4)2S2O8 aqueous solution was added dropwise, then 400 mg of CG was added to the solution. 
3. The required precursor was obtained by stirring the mixture for 48  hours at room temperature. 
4. Vacuum drying of the precursor at 60°C was followed by pyrolysis at 900°C for 1 hour with a stream of argon gas
5. The resulting product was then leached with 2 M H2SO4 at 60°C for 12 hours. 
6. The carefully washed product was then vacuum dried at 60 °C
