question
Synthesis of Atomically dispersed Mn on aryl amino substituted g-C3N4, denoted by Mn/AB-C3N4  

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor Mn (NO3)2.4H2O and support aryl amino substituted g-C3N4

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. 9 g of DCDA (Dicyandiamide), 0.08 mmol of Mn (NO3)2.4H2O (20.08mg) and 0.15 g of 2aminobenzonitrile were stirred together in 45 mL of H2O at 95 °C for 1hr in a closed system and then  dried at 100 °C to remove water. 
2. Afterward, solids were ground to fine powders and heated to 550 °C at a rate of 2.2 °C/min and was kept at this temperature for 4 hrs under an aerobic atmosphere. 
3. After that  the oven was cooled down to room temperature, resulting mixture was removed and ground in an algae mortar and used for the subsequent reactions. 
4. The as-prepared catalyst was stored in a screw-capped vial without any special protection from air at room temperature. 
5. The Mn-based modified g-C3N4 catalyst  was named Mn/AB-C3N4.
