question
Preparation of single atom Fe supported on UiO-66

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor FeCl3·6H2O and support UiO-66

The support UiO-66 is prepared as followed:
1. 20 mg of ZrCl4 and 14.25 mg of H2BDC were dissolved in 10 mL of DMF containing 1.83 mL of HOAc. 
2. The mixture was sealed into a 20 mL glass vial and allowed to react at 120 °C for 24 h. 
3. The white product was collected by centrifugation and washed with DMF and menthol. 
4. After washing, the product was immersed in the methanol to exchange out the DMF, followed by drying under vacuum at 60 °C overnight.

After the synthesis of support UiO-66, the catalyst synthesis procedures are prepared as followed:
1. 40 mg of UiO-66 and 80 mg of FeCl3·6H2O were ultrasonically dispersed in 4 mL of MeCN. 
2. The mixture was transferred into a 7 mL microwave vessel and sealed. 
3. The reaction was then rapidly heated to 85 °C by a microwave reactor (CEM Discover SP) and held at this temperature for 30 min with continuous stirring. 
4. After cooling to room temperature, the solid was isolated by centrifugation and washed with H2O and methanol to remove the excess Fe3+.
5. The synthesized  Fe-UiO-66 was obtained by dried at 60 °C under vacuum.
