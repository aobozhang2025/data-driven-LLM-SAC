question
Synthesis of single atom Pt supported on carbon black

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by irradiation with metal precursor chloroplatinic acid.

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. The chloroplatinic acid was firstly solved in ethanol with 0.05 M. 
2. The solution was dropped onto carbon black (CB, BP2000) with a loading amount of ~0.1 ml/mg, followed by ultrasonication for 1 h and dried in vacuum oven at room temperature.  
3. To synthesize Pt species, the precursors-loaded substrates were dispersed in hexane at 0.5 mg/ml under stirring. 
4. The solution was irradiated with a fiber laser for 8 h under stirring, ensuring all the substrates to interact with laser beam. 
5. Finally, the mixture was centrifuged and rinsed several times in ethanol to remove the unreacted salt precursors, and the sample was dried in a vacuum oven.
