question
Preparation of single atom Ti supported on reduced graphite oxide

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor Ti salt (titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate)) and support reduced graphite oxide

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. First, 400 mg of graphite oxide was dispersed into 120 ml of isopropanol. 
2. Then, 20 μl of organic Ti salt (titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate)) was added into the above solution with continuous magnetic stirring, followed by ultrasonic dispersion for 1 h and magnetic stirring for 20 h. 
3. Afterwards, the above dispersion solution was centrifuged and the resulting precipitation was dried at 85 °C in vacuum for 24 h. 
4. Thereafter, the obtained powder was calcinated at 550 °C for 2 h in a high-purity N2 atmosphere. 
5. After cooling to room temperature, the fluffy black powder was obtained
