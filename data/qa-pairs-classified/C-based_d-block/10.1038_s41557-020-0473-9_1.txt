question
Preparation of single atom Ir doped by N supported on Carbon

answer
The catatyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor Ir(acac)3 and support carbon

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (1.069 g, 3.6 mmol) and Ir(acac)3 (176 mg, 0.36 mmol) were dissolved in 15 ml methanol
2. the resulting solution was then added into 10 ml of methanol containing 1.161 g (14.2 mmol) 2-methylimidazole. 
3. After vigorously stirring for 5 min, the mixed solutions were kept at room temperature without stirring for 20 h. 
4. The Ir(acac)3@ZIF-8 nanocrystal was collected by centrifugation, washed four times with methanol and dried in vacuum overnight. 
5. The powder of Ir(acac)3@ ZIF-8 was then placed in a tube furnace and heated to 900 °C for 3 h at the heating rate of 5 °C min–1 under argon gas (200 ml min–1). 
6. The result powder was calcined twice again with the same condition as above. 
7. After calcination, the samples were cooled to room temperature
