question
Synthesis of single atom Co supported on N-doped carbon

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor Co3[Co(CN)6]2

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. 0.012 mol of potassium hexacyanocobaltate (K3Co(CN)6) was dissolved in 70 mL of water. 
2. Next, 0.09 mol of zinc chloride (ZnCl2) was dissolved in 20 mL of water, which was slowly added to the former solution in 1 h at 50 °C with vigorous stirring. 
3. Then, 15.0 g of poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene glycol)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (P123, average molecular weight 5800) and 40 mL of tert-butanol were added over 10 min and the mixture was stirred continuously for 1 h. 
4. Subsequently, the resultant white solid was collected, washed with water and ethanol to remove the unreacted ions, and then dried at 120 °C for 8 h. Similarly, the double-metal cyanide Co3[Co(CN)6]2 was prepared by an identical method except for changing ZnCl2 to cobaltous nitrate (Co(NO3)2).
5. Then, Zn3[Co(CN)6]2 was heated to 900 °C for 2 h at a heating  rate of 3 °C/min under a N2 atmosphere to obtain the Conanoparticle-supported nitrogen-doped carbon layer Co@Co-NC. 
6. Then, 0.1 g of Co@Co-NC was added to 30 mL of an aqueous solution of H2SO4 (2.0 M) and heated at 50 °C for 12 h with vigorous stirring. 
7. The Co nanoparticles were removed, and the single-atom Co-dispersed nitrogen-doped carbon Co-NC was synthesized. 
8. Finally, the resultant solid was collected by washing with water until the pH of the filtrate reached 7.0 and then dried at 120 °C for 8 h.
