Synthesis of single atom Co supported on N-doped graphene reduced at 900 C

answer
The catalyst is prepared by impregnation with metal precursor CoCl2·6H2O and support precursor graphene oxide (GO)

The catalyst is prepared as followed:
1. graphene oxide (GO) was washed with hydrochloric acid solution and acetone to remove the metal impurities (for example, manganese) that are left during the Hummers method of producing GO 
2. It was then dried in an electric oven at 40 °C overnight. 
3. 30 mg of acid-treated GO was dispersed in 30 ml of water. 
4. CoCl2·6H2O was dispersed in water (3 mg ml−1) and 202 ul of the solution was added into the GO solution. 
5. The mixed solution was sonicated for 1 h and then freeze-dried for 2 days. 
6. The prepared metal-adsorbed GO foam was collected into an alumina crucible and then placed at the centre of a tube furnace. \
7. With the continuous feeding of ammonia (50 sccm) and argon (150 sccm) gas, the furnace was heated up to 900 °C (ramping rate = 5 °C min−1) and held at 900 °C for 1 h, followed by natural cooling under a continuous flow of Ar (150 sccm). 
8. The collected dark greyish catalyst was dispersed in isopropanol (1 mg ml−1) for further use.
