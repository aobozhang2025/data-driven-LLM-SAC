question
Synthesis of single atom Co doped by 4 P supported on N-doped carbon

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by a framework of ZIF synthesis

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. 36.7 mg of Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 293.3 mg Zn(NO3)2·6H2O were dissolved in 90 mL deionized water under stirring to prepare solution 1 
2. 985 mg of 2-methylimidazole was dissolved in 90 mL deionized with bath sonication assistance for 3 min to prepare solution 2
3. Then, solution 1 was rapidly  poured into solution 2 and homogenized via ultrasonication for 20 min. 
4. The mixed  solution was then transferred into a 250 ml flask and stirred for another 12 h at room temperature. 
5. The as-acquired solid precipitate (marked as CoZn-ZIF) was separated by centrifugation at 7000 rpm and washed with 70% aqueous ethanol solution under ultrasonication for 8 min. 
6. The centrifugation and ultrasonic washing were repeated four times to remove the residual 2-methylimidazole ligand, and the final product was dried at 65 °C in a vacuum oven for 12h.  
7. the product was thermally annealed in a tube furnace at 800 °C for 2 h at a ramping rate of 3.3 oC min-1 under the argon protection (150 sccm).
8. After that, the tube furnace was naturally cooled to room temperature to collect the solid product
9. the product was placed downstream of the tube furnace and were phosphided by pH3 generated from sufficient amounts of NaH2PO2 (placed upstream) at different temperatures (220 to 500 °C) for 2 h at a ramping rate of 2.5 oC min-1 under the argon protection. 
10. After that, the tube furnace was cooled to room temperature naturally, and the final product  was obtained.
