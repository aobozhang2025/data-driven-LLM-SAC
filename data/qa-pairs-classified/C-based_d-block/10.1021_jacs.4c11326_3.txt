question
Synthesis of single atom Fe doped by N supported on carbon

answer
The catalyst is prepared by impregnation with metal precursor Fe(phen)3 complex and support N-doped carbon (NC)

The support N-doped carbon (NC) is prepared as followed:
1. 3.06 g 2-methylimidazole (MeIM) was dissolved in 70 ml methanol, which was subsequently added into140 ml methanol containing 2.77 g  Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and stirred for 20 min. 
2. The mixture was then transferred to a reactor and  heated at 120°C for 4 hours to form the ZIF-8. 
3. The as-obtained precipitates were  centrifuged and washed with methanol three times and dried under a vacuum condition at 60 °C overnight.
4. Finally, the powder was placed in a tube furnace and heated to 950 °C  with a heating rate of 5 °C min-1 and held at that temperature for 5 h under the Ar atmosphere to yield NC.  

The metal precursor is prepared as followed:
1. 0.5 mmol of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O was dissolved in 15 ml of de-ionized (DI) water and 1.5  mmol of 1,10-phenanthroline was dissolved in 15 mL of ethanol, respectively. 
2. Then, two solutions were mixed under stirring to form Fe(phen)3 solution. 

After the preparation of N-doped carbon (NC), the catalyst is synthesized as followed:
1. 100 mg NC was added into 50 mL ethanol and dispersed by ultrasound to obtain a black suspension solution. 
2. Then, a 2.2 mL of Fe(phen)3 complex was added into the above black suspension and stirred for 3 h at room temperature. 
3. After that, the  suspension was centrifuged and the precipitate was dried at 60°C overnight. 
4. Finally, the asobtained black powder was heated at 950 °C for 1 h with a heating rate of 5 °C min-1 in an  Ar atmosphere.
