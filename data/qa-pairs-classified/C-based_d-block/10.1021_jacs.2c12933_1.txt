question
Preparation of single atom Fe supported on N-doped carbon 

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by the synthesis framework of ZIF-8.

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. 60 mg of Fe(NO3)3∙9H2O and 2.5 g of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O were dissolved in a 200 mL methanol solution. 
2. 200 mL methanol with 3.0 g of 2-methylimidazole were then added to the above mixture. 
3. After a 24 h reaction at 60 °C, Fe-ZIF-8 powder was collected by centrifuging and washing processes. 
4. After that, the precipitates, were centrifuged, washed, and dried. 
5. The powder was milled and then pyrolyzed in the tube furnace at 1000 °C for 1 h under an argon atmosphere. 
6. The heating rate and gas flow rate were set to be 35 °C min-1 and 50 mL min-1, respectively.
