question
synthesis of single atom Fe supported on BLG (β-lactoglobulin)

answer
The catalyst is prepared by impregnation with metal precursor Fe(NO3)3·9H2O

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. 100 mg lyophilized BLG powder was dispersed in a mixture of 8.0 ml ethanol and 1.9 ml PEG200. 
2. The dispersion was then subjected to argon bubbling for 30 min to remove the dissolved oxygen, followed by irradiation under a xenon lamp with an ultraviolet filter (250–380 nm, 27.9 mW cm−2, PLS-SXE300CUV) for 10 min to generate free radicals. 
3. Subsequently, 0.1 ml of 108.21 mg ml−1 Fe(NO3)3·9H2O EDTA solution was added dropwise to the dispersion of BLG under magnetic stirring for 12 h at 25 °C. 
4. samples were collected by centrifugation at 4 °C, 11,100g for 10 min, washed by ethanol (10.0 ml × 6) and resuspended in 5.0 ml deionized water (pH 2).
