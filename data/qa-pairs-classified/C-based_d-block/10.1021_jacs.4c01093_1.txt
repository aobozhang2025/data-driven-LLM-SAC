question
Synthesis of single atom Fe doped by N supported on carbon

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor FeCl3·6H2O

The catalyst is synthesized with the following procedures:
1. FeCl3·6H2O (125 mg) was added into anhydrous ethanol (40 mL) and stirred for 10 min. 
2. Subsequently, 1,10-phenanthroline (Phen) ethanol solution (10 mL, 18 mg mL−1) was added dropwise and sonicated for 30 min. 
3. After that, phen  (90 mg) and Mg(OH)2 (4 g) were added into the mixture and sonicated for 30 min. 
4. The  mixture was heated under reflux at 60 oC for 4 h and then evaporated at 70 oC. 
5. The solid was dried in vacuo for 12 h and was further calcined under N2 atmosphere at 700 oC (pyrolysis  temperature) for 2 h with the temperature ramping rate of 2 oC min−1. 
6. The black powder  obtained after calcination was stirred in 1 M HNO3 solution for 2 h to remove MgO and  residual Fe nanoparticles. 
7. The final solid was collected and washed with ethanol/water (v/v = 1) for 5 times and dried in vacuo at 60 oC for 12 h.
