question
The synthesis of single atom Pt supported on DG

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor H2PtCl6·6H2O

The support Defective Graphene (DG) is prepared as followed:
1. the graphene was mixed with melamine (mass ratio is 1:2) 
2. annealed at 700 oC for 2 h and then annealed at 1150 oC for 2 h with a ramp rate of 5 oC  under an atmosphere of nitrogen.  

After the preparation of Defective Graphene (DG), the catalyst are synthesized as followed:
1. DG (30 mg) was added in 30 mL ethanol in a 50 mL beaker, the beaker was placed into ultrasonic cleaning machine and then ultrasound at room  temperature for 1 h. 
2. Then H2PtCl6·6H2O (0.9 mg) was added into the turbid liquid and lighted by the xenon lamp for 10 minutes
3. after washing with deionized water for three times, the prepared sample was dried and Pt@DG was finally obtained.
