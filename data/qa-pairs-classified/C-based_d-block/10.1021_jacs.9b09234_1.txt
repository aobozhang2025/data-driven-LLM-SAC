question
synthesis of single atom Ru doped by N supported on carbon

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by a framework of ZIF-8 synthesis

The catalyst is prepared as followed:
1. 79.2 mmol of 2-methylimidazole was dissolved in 80 mL of methanol with vigorous stirring
2. then 10.1 mmol Zn(NO3)3·6H2O with 0.52 mmol of Ru(acac)3 in 40 mL  methanol was poured into above solution with vigorous stirring for 24 h at room temperature. 
3. The obtained precipitates were separated by centrifugation and washed with methanol for several times and finally dried in vacuum at 50 °C for overnight. 
4. The as-obtained precursor was transferred into a quartz boat and placed in a tube furnace, then heated to the desired temperature (950 °C) for 1 h at the heating rate of  5 °C·min-1 under flowing10% H2/Ar mix gas and then naturally cooled to room temperature, 
5. then prebleached in 1 M HNO3 to remove unstable species.
