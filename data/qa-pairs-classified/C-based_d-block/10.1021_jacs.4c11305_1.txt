question
Preparation of single atom Pd supported on N and S doped Carbon

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor Pd/C and support precursor ZIF-8

The support precursor ZIF-8 is prepared as followed:
1. 1.069 mg Zn(NO3)2·6H2O was dissolved in a 15 ml DMF and methanol mixed solvent (large particle size, 200 nm in diameter: DMF/methanol =  1/4; small particle size, 50 nm in diameter: DMF/methanol = 4/1, volume ratio) in flask  A, and then stirred for 5 min to form a clear solution.
2. 1.161 mg 2-methylimidazole was dissolved in 10 mL mixed solvent and stirred for 5 min to form a clear solution in flask B.
3. Then, we added the contents of flask B dropwise into flask A at room temperature and maintained for 12 h without stirring. 
4. The obtained white powder was washed by ethanol for 3 times and dried at 70 °C under vacuum.  

After the preparation of support precursor, the catalyst is synthesized with the following procedures:
1. 100 mg commercial Pd/C would be transferred to a ceramic boat and placed in a tube furnace 
2. 300 mg sulfur powder was placed upwind from Pd/C. 
3. The sample was heated at 600 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C·min-1 and kept for 2 h  under flowing nitrogen gas to ensure the Pd NPs were completely poisoned by sulfur 
4. 50 mg prepared Pd-S/C was mixed with 200 mg ZIF-8 in 15 ml ethanol and stirred in an open flask at 75 °C until dried. 
5. The mixture would be further grind to ensure its uniformity  (Pd-S/C/ZIF-8). 
6. The mixture was transferred to a tube furnace, heated to 950 °C (heating rate of 5 °C · min-1) under flowing nitrogen gas, kept for 3 h, and then cooled to room temperature naturally.
