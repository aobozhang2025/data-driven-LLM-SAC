question
Preparation of single atom Mn supported on N-doped carbon

answer
The catatyst is synthesized by impregnation with Mn acetylacetonates and support carbon

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. A solution of  Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (1.069 g, 3.6 mmol) and Mn acetylacetonates (0.22–0.36 mmol) were dissolved in 15 ml methanol at 30–55 °C
2. the resulting solution was subsequently added to10 ml of methanol containing 2-methylimidazole (1.161 g, 14.2 mmol). 
3. After vigorously stirring for 5 min, the mixed solutions were kept at room temperature without stirring for 20 h. 
4. The solid products were collected by centrifugation and washed four times with methanol and dried in vacuum overnight. 
5. The powders of the metal acetylacetonates @ZIF-8 were placed in a tube furnace and heated to 800/900 °C for 3 h at a heating rate of 5 °C min–1 under argon gas (200 ml min–1). 
6. After calcination, the samples were cooled to room temperature
