question
Synthesis of single atom Co doped by 4 N supported on N-C, denoted by Co1-N4. 

answer
The catalyst is prepared by impregnation with metal precursor CoCl2 and support ZIF-8

The support ZIF-8 is prepared as followed:
1. Zn(NO3)2∙6H2O (1.069 g, 3.6 mmol) was dissolved in  20 mL methanol. 
2. Then the solution was added into 20 mL of methanol containing 2-methyimidazole (1.161 g, 14.2 mmol). 
3. After vigorously stirring for 5 minutes, the mixed solutions were transferred into a 50 mL Telfon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and subjected to treatment at 120 oC  for 4 h. The autoclave was cooled down to room temperature. 
4. The solid products were collected by centrifugation and washed five times with methanol.
5. Finally, the products were dried at 70 oC under vacuum overnight.  

After the support ZIF-8 is prepared, the catalyst is synthesized as followed:
1. ZIF-8 (100 mg) were dispersed in 30 mL methanol.  
2. Subsequently, the solution was added to 20 mL of methanol containing CoCl2 (10 mg). 
3. The mixed solutions were vigorously stirred at 40 oC for 16 hours. Afterward, the mixture was cooled down to room temperature. 
4. The solid products (Co-P/ZIF-8) were collected by centrifugation and  washed five times with methanol. 
5. Finally, the Co-P/ZIF-8 was placed in a tube furnace and heated under argon gas flow (100 mL/min) at a heating rate of 5 oC/min to reach a temperature of 950 oC for 3 h after drying the products at 70 oC under vacuum overnight.
