question
Preparation of single atom Co supported on CNCl/S

answer
The catalyst is prepared impregnation with metal precursor  CoSO4·7H2O

The catalyst is prepared as followed:
1. NaCl (3 g), glucose (300 mg), CoSO4·7H2O (28.1 mg) and dicyandiamide (332 mg) were dissolved in 30 ml of deionized water and stirred continuously for 2 h. 
2. The resulting solution was freeze dried under vacuum to yield a powder, which was then ground in a mortar and pyrolysed at 900 °C for 2 h under an argon atmosphere, with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. 
3. After cooling to room temperature, the black powder was subjected to acid etching with 0.5 M H2SO4 to remove unstable Co species and NaCl.
4. The obtained black powder was dried at 60 °C, and the sample was designated as Co1CNCl/S.
