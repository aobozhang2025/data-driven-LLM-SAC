question
synthesis of single atom Pt supported on N-C 

answer
The catalyst is prepared by impregnation with metal precursor chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6.6H2O) and support nitrogen-doped carbon

The support nitrogen-doped carbon is prepared as followed:
1. dissolving 12.75 g zinc nitrate hexahydrate and 29.15 g 2-methyl imidazole separately in deionized water (DIW) (250 ml each). 
2. After mixing the two solutions, the mixture was stirred for 2 h and left still for 16 h. 
3. The resulting precipitate was filtered off, washed with DIW (3 l) and ethanol (1 l), and dried at 80 °C. 
4. The obtained 2D-ZIF-8 was mixed with KCl (20 g per g metal–organic framework), which was previously dissolved in water (0.5 g ml−1). 
5. The water was removed in a rotary evaporator and then the solid was dried in a vacuum oven set a 80 °C. 
6. N-C was obtained after carbonization at 700 °C (5 h, N2 flow, 2 °C min−1 heating rate) and a washing treatment consisting of hydrochloric acid (2 M in water), deionized water and ethanol followed by drying at 80 °C. 

After the support nitrogen-doped carbon is prepare, the catalyst is synthesized as followed:
1. A target amount of chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6.6H2O) was dissolved in 20 ml DIW and added to 250 mg NC. 
2. After sonication for 15 min, the water was evaporated and the powder dried at 80 °C overnight. 
3. The first annealing step was carried out at 200 °C (5 h, N 2 flow, 5 °C min −1 heating rate). 
4. The catalyst was then suspended in a 1 M NH4Cl solution, sonicated for 30 min and removed by centrifugation. 
5. This process was repeated twice more with the 1 M NH4Cl solution and three more times with DIW. 
6. After another drying step, the material was annealed a second time at 550 °C (5 h, N2 flow, 2 °C min−1 heating rate).
