question
synthesis of single atom Fe supported on O modified N-rich carbon

answer
This catalyst is synthesized by calcination of metal particles combined with ZIF-8

The ZIF-8 is synthesized as followed:
1. Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (558 mg) was dissolved in 20 ml methanol to form a clear solution, which was subsequently added into 20 ml of methanol containing 616 mg 2-methylimidazole under stirring for 6 h at room temperature. 
2. The as-obtained white precipitates were centrifuged and washed with methanol four times and dried in vacuum at 70°C.  

After the synthesis of ZIF-8, it was calcinated to N-rich carbon, the procedures are as followed:
1. ZIF-8 powder was placed into a porcelain boat and then was heated up to 900 °C for 3 h at a rate of 5 °C/min under Ar atmosphere within a tube furnace. 
2. After cooling down to the room temperature, the obtained black product was leached with 0.5 M HCl to remove unstable species and successively washed using distilled water. 
3. The as-obtained black solid was dried in vacuum at 70°C.  

The catalyst are synthesized as followed with N-rich carbon:
1. N-rich carbon (NC) was simply mixed with commercial Fe particles 
2. NH4Cl was then added into the above mixture for further grinding. 
3. The obtained composite consisting of NC, metal particle Fe and NH4Cl was annealed under Ar atmosphere at 500 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C/min  for 1 h. 
4. For Fe particles the mixture underwent a two-step annealing process as below: retained at 225 oC for 1h, then increased to 500 oC and held for 1 h with a ramping rate of 5 oC/min. 
Note: NH4Cl will decompose into NH3 and HCl at above ~160 °C, which will condense into solid NH4Cl in the downstream direction of tube furnace where the temperature is lower than that at the center of tube furnace. Such a phenomenon can greatly avoid the corrosion to the tube furnace.
