question
synthesis of single atom Co supported on 2,5-diaminobenzene-1,4dithiol (DABDT), denoted by Co-DABDT

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor CoCl2

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. 0.2 mmol of DABDT·2HCl (analytic grade, purchased from Yanshen Technology) was dissolved in 10 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, analytic grade, purchased from Aladdin Biochemical Technology) to form solution I. 
2. CoCl2 (0.2 mmol, analytic grade, purchased from Aladdin Biochemical Technology) was dissolved in 10 mL of deionized water to form solution II.
3. The above two solutions were mixed and added with 200 μL of ammonia solution diluted 20 times and several pieces of Ni foam. 
4. The solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave (50.0 mL) and heated to 70 °C for 12 h. 
5. The products were collected and washed via centrifugation and dried at 80 °C in a vacuum overnight.
