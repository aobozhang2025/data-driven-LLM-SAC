question
synthesis of single atom Ir supported on NiO/CC

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor chloroiridic acid and support NiO/carbon cloth

The support NiO/carbon cloth is prepared as followed:
1. the carbon cloth (CC) was first treated with concentrated HNO3 at 130 °C to remove impurities and then washed with deionized water several times to ensure a sufficiently clean surface. 
2. The cleaned CC (1 × 3 cm) was then immersed into a 20 mL aqueous solution containing 0.8  g of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.8 g of hexamethylenetetramine (HMT). 
3. The mixed system was then sealed and maintained at 95 °C for 9 h. 
4. The as-deposited CC was then washed with water and dried in air. 
5. The dried CC was subsequently placed in a muffle furnace and heated to 350 °C from room temperature in 20 min. 
6. maintaining at 350 °C for 2 h and cooled to room temperature

After the preparation of support NiO/carbon cloth (NiO/CC), the catalyst is synthesized as followed:
1. immersing a piece of NiO/CC into a 0.2mg/mL chloroiridic acid ethanol solution for 10 min and then taken out and dried at 80 °C. 
2. Subsequently, the dried carbon cloth (CC) was placed in a muffle furnace and heated to 350 °C in 20 min. 
3. After maintaining at 350 °C for 2 h, the CC was cooled to room temperature and washed with water several times. 
4. drying the carbon cloth (CC) in air.
