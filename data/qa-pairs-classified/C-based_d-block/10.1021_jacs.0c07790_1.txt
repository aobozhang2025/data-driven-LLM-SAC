question
Synthesis of single atom Co dope by 4 N supported on C

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor Co(OAc)2·4H2O, support TIPP and template SiO2

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. 0.6 mL of TEOS was quickly injected into a stirred mixture of deionized water (5 mL), absolute ethanol (15 mL), and 28% NH 3·H2O (0.7 mL). 
2. After continuous stirring for 10 h, precipitates were collected by centrifugation, washed with ethanol for three times and dried. The silica spheres were obtained
3. Co(OAc)2·4H2O (150 mg) and TIPP (175 mg) were dissolved in 100 mL DMF
4. the solution was heated to reflux at 175 °C for 3 h. 
5. As the excess solvent was evaporated to give a final volume of 20 mL, the solution left was cooled down to room temperature, added into 200 mL frozen deionized water,  and let stand for 1 h. 
6. Formed precipitates were collected by centrifugation, washed with deionized water for several times and dried in vacuum at 120 °C for 4 h.  The Co-TIPP was obtained
7.a mixture of Co-TIPP (20 mg, 0.02 mmol),  TIPP (280 mg, 0.32 mmol) and silica spheres (500 mg) in 100 mL DMF was prepared in a 250 mL round-bottom flask.  
8. After injection of α,α'-dibromo-p-xylene (179.5 mg, 0.68 mmol) dissolved in 20 ml DMF, the mixture was heated at 110 °C under stirring for 24 h. 
9. The product was collected by centrifugation, washed by DMF and ethanol, and dried at 80 °C under vacuum for 12 h. 
10. Resulting powder (SiO2@Co-TIPP/TIPP-polymer) was collected into a tube furnace and gradually heated to 800 °C in 3 h (5 °C min -1) under H2/Ar (5:95) gas flow. 
11. Then the powder was cooled to room temperature and etched by 6 M NaOH aqueous solution at 60 °C for 24 h to remove the SiO2 template. The final product was centrifuged, washed by water and ethanol, and dried at 30 °C  in vacuum overnight.
