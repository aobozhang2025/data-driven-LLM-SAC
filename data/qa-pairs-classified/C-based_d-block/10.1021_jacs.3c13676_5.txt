question
Preparation of Ru single atoms supported on nitrogen-doped carbon, denoted by Ru SAs/NC.  

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by a framework of ZIF synthesis with metal precursor Ruthenium acetylacetonate

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. Ruthenium acetylacetonate (0.3 mmol) and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (1.069 g) were dissolved in 15 ml methanol. 
2. 10 ml of methanol containing 2-methyl imidazole (1.161 g) was added  to the above solution. 
3. After stirring, the mixed solutions were transferred to a Teflon-lined stainlesssteel autoclave and maintained at 120°C for 4 hours. 
4. The solid products were collected by centrifugation and washed with methanol. 
5. After drying, the obtained powder was further pyrolyzed in an Ar atmosphere at 900 °C for 3 h.
