Synthesis of single atom Fe doped by P supported on N-C

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by preparation of Single atom Fe doped by N supported on carbon:
1. 1.190 g Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.141 g Fe(acac)3 were added to 30 mL methanol to form solution A. 
2. Meanwhile, 1.314 g 2-MeIM was added into 15 mL methanol to form solution B. 
3. Then, solution B was added into solution A under vigorous stirring, and the mixture was kept under continuous stirring for 16 h at room  temperature. 
4. After that, the mixture with precipitates generated inside was centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 3.0 min. 
5. The obtained precipitates were then washed with DMF and  methanol for three times, respectively, and further dried at 70°C overnight. 
6. After that,  the ZIF-8@Fe(acac)3 precursor was obtained 
7. The ZIF-8@Fe(acac)3 precursor was then transferred into a ceramic boat. The  ceramic boat was placed in the center of a horizontal quartz tube which was installed in  a furnace in advance. 
8. Under continuous argon gas of 200 mL min−1 in the quartz tube,  the furnace was heated to 900°C with a heating rate of 5°C min−1 and kept at 900°C for 3.0 h. 

Then doped by P as followed:
1. Firstly, 800 mg PPh3 was dissolved into 40 mL toluene. 
2. Then, 120 mg FeNC was added into the above solution, followed by ultrasonication for 5.0 min and stirring for 24 h at room temperature. 
3. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 3.0  min to remove the liquid. 
4. The solid sample was then washed with toluene for two times, dried at 70°C for 2.0 h, and transferred into a ceramic boat which was placed in the center of the horizontal quartz tube installed in the furnace. 
5. Under continuous argon gas  (200 mL min−1), the furnace was heated to 900°C with a heating rate of 10°C min−1 and  then kept at 900°C for 2.0 h.
