question
Synthesis of the single atom Pt supported on N-doped carbon nanotubes 

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with precursor H2PtCl6

The support N-doped carbon nanotubes denoted by N-CNT is prepared as followed:
1. First, MnO2 nanowires as the template and oxidant were prepared by the hydrothermal method. 
2. Then 200 mg of MnO2 nanowires were added into 100 mL deionized water  (DIW) (solution A). 
3. Pyrrole (0.51 mL) and aniline (0.39 mL) were added into 100 mL  of 0.05 M H2SO4 solution (solution B). 
4. The above two solutions were mixed under vigorous stirring. 
5. After continuous stirring for 4 h, a black product was obtained, which  was further subjected to rinse with a large amount of DIW to remove the residuary Mn.  
6. Lastly, the as-obtained product was heated to 920 °C for 2 h under N2 flow to yield the  N-CNTs.  

the catalyst is synthesized as followed:
1. The as-synthesized N-CNTs (40.0 mg) were first dispersed in 20 mL DIW under  ultrasonic vibration and magnetic stirring. 
2. A H2PtCl6 solution (2.0 mg/mL in DIW) of  268 μL was next added dropwise into the N-CNTs dispersion under stirring at ambient temperature. 3. After continuous stirring overnight, the solid composite was separated from the suspension by vacuum filtration. 
4. The recovered solid was then dried at 70 °C  for 12 h and reduced in 5% H2/Ar at 160 °C for 0.5 h with a heating rate of 5 °C min-1.
