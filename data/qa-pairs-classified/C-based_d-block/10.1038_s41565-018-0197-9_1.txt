question
Preparation of Pd single atoms supported on N-doped Carbon

answer
The catalyst is prepared in a framework of ZIF-8 synthesis

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. Dissolve 34 mg KI and 100 mg PVP (Mw ~55,000) in 10 ml formamide and heated the solution at 120 °C. 
2. Then, 59 mg Na2PdCl4 powder was added and the temperature was maintained for 10 min with vigorous stirring. 
3. After the mixture was cooled down to room temperature, 120 ml acetone was added and the dispersion was collected by centrifugation at 15,000 r.p.m. for 5 min. 
4. The obtained Pd nanoparticles were dispersed in 21 ml mixed solvent (volume ratio DMF:methanol is 4:1).
5. 1,069 mg Zn(NO3)2·6H2O was dissolved in 15 ml mixed solvent (volume ratio DMF:methanol is 4:1) under ultrasound for 5 min to form a clear solution in flask A. 
6. Then 0.5 ml as-prepared Pd nanoparticles dispersed in DMF and methanol solution (~1 mgPd ml–1) was added into flask A. 
7. 1,161 mg 2-methylimidazole was dissolved in 10 ml mixed solvent (DMF:methanol, 4:1.) under ultrasound for 5 min to form a clear solution in flask B. 
8. Then, we added the contents of flask B into flask A at room temperature and maintained the temperature for 12 h without stirring. 
9. The obtained product was collected by centrifugation at 15,000 r.p.m. for 5 min and washed with methanol three times and finally dried at 70 °C for 5 h.  
10. We transferred Pd nanoparticles supported on ZIF-8 powder into a ceramic boat and placed it in a tube furnace. 
11. The sample was heated to 900 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C min–1 and kept at 900 °C for 3 h under flowing nitrogen gas and then cooled to room temperature naturally.
