question
Synthesis of single atom Nb supported on N-doped carbon, denoted by Nb-SAs@NC

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor niobium ethoxide 

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. 2.97 g Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 3.28 g 2-methylimidazole were dissolved in methanolic solution (100 mL), respectively.  
2. Subsequently, two solutions were mixed with vigorous stirring for 10 h. 
3. The precipitates were collected by centrifuged, washed and dried at 80 °C for 10 h. 
4. The composite was pyrolyzed at 650 °C for 1 h with a heating rate of 5 °C min–1 under a  flowing Ar atmosphere to obtain pre-pyrolyzed NC-650
5. The mixture of pre-pyrolyzed NC-650 (0.1 g) and niobium ethoxide (7 uL) was added to 100 mL ethanol and vigorously stirred. 
6. After that, the resulting products were washed and dried, followed by laying them in a  porcelain boat and maintained at 960 °C for 3 h under a flowing Ar atmosphere,  yielding Nb-SAs@NC powders.
