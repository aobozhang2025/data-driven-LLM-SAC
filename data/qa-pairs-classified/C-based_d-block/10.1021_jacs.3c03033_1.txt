question
synthesis of single atom Fe supported on N-doped carbon, denoted by FeNC

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor FeCl3•6H2O

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. 2 mL Aniline (Sigma-Aldrich) was first dissolved in 500 mL of 0.5 M HCl solution. 
2. metal precursors (6.05 g FeCl3•6H2O) were added into the solution and the solution was stirred for 15 min. 
3. After homogenization, 5 g ammonium peroxydisulfate (APS, (NH4)2S2O8, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in the solution, to act as an oxidant to form polyaniline, followed by adding 0.4 g of the pretreated carbon. 
4. The carbon (Ketjen EC 600JC) was previously pretreated with a mixed acid solution consisting of 500 mL of 0.5 M HCl and 100 mL of 67% HNO3 for 7-8 h at 80-90°C, in order to remove metal residues possibly present. 
5. The pre-treatment also functionalizes the carbon with N- and O-groups, favoring interaction with polyaniline.
6. The polymer/carbon/metal suspension was stirred for 1 hour at room temperature, refluxed afterwards for 5 h at 80-90°C and then dried at 80 °C overnight with an oil bath. 
7. The subsequent dried powder was ball milled for 20 min, pouring the powder inside a ZrO2 vial along with 10 ZrO2 beads of 5 mm diameter, at a rotation of 875 rpm. 
8. The milled  powder was then pyrolyzed at 900 °C for 1 h in N2. 
9. The quartz tube was purged with N2 for 2 h before ramping the temperature at 5 °C/min up to 900 °C. 
10. The oven temperature was held at 900°C for 1 h under N2 flow, then let to cool down overnight under N2 flow. 
11. The powder was then twice  acid leached for 7-8 h at 80-90°C in 1.0 M H2SO4  solution
12. the powder was pyrolyzed again after each acid washing, with the same pyrolysis protocol as described above, except that the pyrolysis duration was increased to 3 h.
