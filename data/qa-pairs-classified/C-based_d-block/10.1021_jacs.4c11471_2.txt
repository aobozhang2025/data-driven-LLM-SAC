question
Synthesis of single atom Fe supported on carbon nitride nanotubes (CNNT)

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation and freeze-drying with metal precursor Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and support carbon nitride nanotubes (CNNT)

The support carbon nitride nanotubes (CNNT) is prepared as followed:
1. 12 mmol (1.5 g) of melamine was first dissolved in 80 mL of deionized water at 80 °C, and stirred for 1 h with a speed of 400 rpm. 
2. Then, the transparent solution was transferred to a 100 mL stainless steel reactor and heated at 180 °C for 24 h. 
3. After the solution was cooled down, the white precipitate was collected and washed with deionized water three times. 
4. Then, the precipitate was freeze-dried for 12 h. 
5. Finally, the white sediment was heated in a tube furnace under argon to 500 °C at 5 °C min-1 ramp for 1.5 h.  

After the preparation of support carbon nitride nanotubes (CNNT), the catalyst is synthesized as followed:
1. 12 mmol of melamine, 0.12 mmol of EDTA and 0.12 mmol of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O were dissolved in 80 mL deionized water at 80 °C and further stirred for 1 h, respectively. 
2. The resulting mixture was transferred to a 100 mL stainless steel reactor and heated at 180 °C for 24 h. 
3. After the mixture was cooled down, the precipitate was collected and further centrifuged with deionized water for three times. 
4. Then, the precipitate was freeze-dried for 12 h. 
5. The product was heated in a tube furnace under argon to 500 °C at 5 °C min-1 ramps for 1.5 h.
