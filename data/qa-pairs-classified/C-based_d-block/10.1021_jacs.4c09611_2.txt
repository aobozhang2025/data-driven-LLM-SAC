Preparation of single atom Pt supported on graphitic carbon nitride (CN)

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor cobalt nitrate or chloroplatinic acid and support graphitic carbon nitride (CN) 

The preparation of graphitic carbon nitride (CN) is as followed:
1. 10 g of melamine was placed in a crucible, which was then sealed with a crucible lid or aluminum foil to ensure a closed reaction environment and prevent volatilization during the thermal polymerization process. 
2. Next, the first sintering step involved placing the crucible in a muffle furnace, setting the temperature to rise from room temperature to 550°C at a rate of 2.5°C/min, and maintaining this temperature for 4 hours to ensure the complete polymerization of melamine into graphitic carbon nitride. 
3. After sintering, the crucible was allowed to cool naturally to room temperature within the furnace. 
4. The sample was then removed and ground into fine powder for the second sintering. 
5. In the second sintering step, the ground powder was placed back into the crucible and returned to the muffle furnace, where the temperature  was increased to 500°C at a rate of 10°C/min and held for 2 hours to further exfoliate and refine the graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets. 
6. Finally, the sample was allowed to cool naturally to room temperature, removed, and ground into powder of approximately 400 mesh for further experiments. 

After the preparation of support graphitic carbon nitride (CN), the catalyst is synthesized as followed:
1. 300 mg of graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets are dispersed in a mixture of 40 mL water and 10 mL ethanol, ultrasonicated at room temperature for 1 hour, then stirred at 1500 rpm for 3 hours, resulting in a milky suspension of the graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets. 
2. Then, 0.2 mL of either chloroplatinic acid aqueous solution (1 mg/mL) is added, along with 1 mg of sodium borohydride for the synthesis of Co SAC catalyst, and the mixture is stirred at 1500 rpm for another 3 hours. 
3. Subsequently, the mixture is exposed to light for 30 minutes, with a wavelength range of 420 nm to 800 nm, completely covered by transparent  glass at the mouth of the beaker. 
4. The light source is positioned 15 cm above the liquid surface, with a power of about 100 μW/cm2  aimed at the liquid surface. 
5. After illumination, the samples are separated by filtration and washed three times with ethanol to remove any residual metal salt solutions.
6. Finally, the samples are vacuum dried at a vacuum level of 3×10-3 kPa and a temperature  of 60°C for 4 hours, yielding Co SAC, Pt SAC, and PtCo DAC photocatalysts, respectively.
