question
synthesis of single atom Pt supported by carbon nanotubes (CNT), denoted by Pt-CNT 

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor K2PtCl4 and support carbon nanotubes (CNT)

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. 90 mg of K2PtCl4 was dissolved in 20 mL of water to prepare a 3 mg/mL Pt stock solution. 
2. A 40 mg amount of CNT was then dispersed in 25 mL of water, followed by tip sonication (SCIENTZ) for 30 min. 
3. Thereafter, 400 μL of Pt stock solution was added dropwise to the CNT suspension under vigorous stirring for a 1.05 wt % Pt target loading and was freezedried in a vacuum, which was denoted as the Pt−CNT precursor.
