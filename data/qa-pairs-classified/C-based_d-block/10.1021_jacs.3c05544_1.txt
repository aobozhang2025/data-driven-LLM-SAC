question
Synthesis of open-pore single atom Fe supported on N-doped Carbon, denoted by OP-Fe-NC

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and support etched ZIF-8

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. 2-Methylimidazole (2.24 g) was dissolved in deionized water (10 mL), and Zn(OAc)2∙2H2O (0.6 g) was dissolved in deionized water (10 mL). 
2. The solutions were mixed and stirred at 500 rpm for 2 h, then allowed to stand at room temperature for 24 h to form rhombic dodecahedral ZIF-8 crystals. 
3. XO (40 mg) was dissolved in deionized water (5 mL) to form a clear purple solution. 
4. The pH of the XO solution was adjusted to 2.5 using HCl to prepare the etchant solution. 
5. This etchant solution was then slowly added to the ZIF-8 colloidal solution, which was stirred at 300 rpm for 3 h at room temperature. 
6. The resulting mixture was centrifuged, and the collected solid (ZIF-8-etching) was washed several times with water and methanol.  
7. The as-prepared ZIF-8-etching (100 mg) and Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (2 mg) were stirred and sonicated in ethanol for 2 h at room temperature. 
8. After filtration and drying at 60 °C for 8 h, FeXO@ZIF-8-etching was obtained. 
9. FeXO@ZIF-8-etching was then pyrolyzed under flowing N2 at 1000 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 and then washed with 0.5 M H2SO4 to obtain a single-atom Fe catalyst (OP-Fe-NC).
