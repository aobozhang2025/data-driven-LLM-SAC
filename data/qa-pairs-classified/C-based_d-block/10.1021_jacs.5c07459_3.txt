question
Synthesis of single atom Fe supported on N-doped carbon 

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor Fe(acac)3

The syntheis procedures are as followed:
1. 2-methylimidazole (1314 mg) was dissolved in 15 mL methanol in flask A.  
2. Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (1190 mg) and Fe(acac)3 (141 mg) was dissolved in 30 mL methanol under ultrasound for 15 min to form a clear solution in flask B. 
3. Then, flask B was subsequently added  into flask A with ultrasound for 30 min and vigorous stirring for 12 h at room temperature. 
4. The  obtained product was separated by centrifugation and washed subsequently with methanol for twice and finally dried at 60 °C under vacuum for overnight. 
5. The power of Fe(acac)3@ZIF-8  was transferred into a ceramic boat and placed in a tube furnace. 
6. The sample was heated to 950  °C with a heating rate of 5 °C min-1 and kept at 900 °C for 3h under flowing Ar gas and then  naturally cooled to room temperature.
