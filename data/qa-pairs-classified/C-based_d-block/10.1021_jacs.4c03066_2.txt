question
Preparation of single atom Co doped by N supported on C under Low Pressure. 

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor Co(acac)3

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. The pyrolysis of ZIF-8  nanoparticles (50 nm) and NaCl at a mass ratio of 1.58 was carried out at 910 °C under an Ar atmosphere for 2 h. 
2. To remove residual Zn, the NC supports were etched with 2 M HCl at 80 °C overnight, followed by washing with water and ethanol six times. 
3. 50 mg of the NC powders was dispersed in 50 mL of methanol and sonicated for 2 h. 
4. 15 mg of Co(acac)3 was then added, and the mixture was stirred continuously overnight. 
5. Methanol was then removed by using a rotary evaporator. 
6. The  resulting mixture was heated to 900 °C (heating rate of 30 °C min−1) in a chemical vapor deposition system under a pressure of 0.87 mbar in an Ar atmosphere. 
7. After 1 h, the sample was obtained
