question
synthesis of single atom Mo supported on N-doped carbon, denoted by Mo1-NC

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor MoCl5.

The N-doped carbon (NC) is first prepared as followed:
1. GLA (0.7-0.9 g) was mixed with SBA-15 (0.5 g) by gentle grinding to obtain SBA-15-Glu. 
2. The SBA-15-Glu was heated to 600 °C (ramping  rate: 2 °C/min) and held there for 2 h, followed by cooling down to room temperature to obtain SBA-15-Glu-600. 
3. Next, the SBA-15 template was removed by acid etching with dilute HF aqueous solution for 24 h. 
4. Afterwards, the pH of the solution was adjusted to neutral (pH = 7.0). 
5. NC-600 was produced by removing water under vacuum below 50 °C. 
6. Finally, the as-prepared sample was calcined at 900 °C (ramping rate:  5 °C/min) for 2 hours in a tube furnace under Ar atmosphere to obtain NC.  

After N-doped carbon is prepared, the catalyst is synthesized as followed:
1. 20 mg of MoCl5 was dissolved in a solution comprising of ethanol (10 mL) and water (10 mL). 
2. Subsequently, NC-600 suspension (10 mL,100 mg/mL)  was added, and the mixture was stirred for 12 hours. 
3. The product was washed with  water and ethanol three times each, and then collected by freeze-drying to obtain NC-600-Mo. 
4. Finally, the fine powder mixture was undergone a two-stage pyrolysis (first stage: from 25 to 600 °C at a ramping rate of 3 °C/min, maintain at 600  °C for 2 h; second stage: from 600 to 900 °C at a ramping rate of 2 °C/min, maintain at  900 °C for 90 min) in a tubular furnace under Ar atmosphere. 
5. After cooling down to room temperature, the final product was collected named as Mo1-NC
