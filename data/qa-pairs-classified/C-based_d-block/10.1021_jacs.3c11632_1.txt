question
Synthesis of hollow mesoporous single atom Pd supported on N-C, denoted by h-Pd/NC 

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by a framework of ZIF with metal precursors Pd(acac)2

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. Zn(NO3)2∙6H2O (1.069 g, 3.6 mmol), Pd(acac)2 (20 mg, 0.066 mmol) were dissolved in 20 mL methanol. 
2. Then the solution was added into 20 mL of methanol containing 2-methy imidazole (1.161 g, 14.2 mmol). 
3. After vigorously stirring for 5 minutes, the mixed solutions were transferred into a 50 mL Telfon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and subjected to treatment at 120 oC for 4 h. 
4. The  autoclave was cooled down to room temperature. 
5. The solid products were collected by  centrifugation and washed five times with methanol. 
6. the products were dried at 70 oC under vacuum overnight.  
7. the products was etched with 100 mL tannic acid solution (7 g/mL) while stirring for 30 min. 
8. The solid products were then washed with  deionized water and methanol for three times. 
9. Finally, the products were dried at 70 oC under  vacuum overnight.  
10. the products were placed in a tube furnace and heated to 950  oC (5 oC/min) for 3 h at a heating rate of under argon gas (100 mL/min).
