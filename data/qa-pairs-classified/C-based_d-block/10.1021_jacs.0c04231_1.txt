question
Synthesis of the single-atom Ni doped by N supported on C

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor nickel nitrate and support ZIF-8.

ZIF-8 is prepared as followed:
1. 1.164 g of 2methylimidazole (MEIM) was dissolved into 20 ml of methanol
2. and then 20 ml of methanol containing 1.096 g of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O was added into the above solution under continuous ultrasound for 15 min at room temperature. 
3. After that, the above milky white suspension was kept at room temperature for 24 h without stirring.  
4. Subsequently, the as-prepared sample was centrifuged at 6000 rpm/min, washed with  methanol four times and further dried under vacuum for 8 h at 70 oC. 

The synthesis procedures of the catalyst are as followed:
1. 200 mg of ZIF-8 was dissolved in 30 ml N-hexane under continuous ultrasonication for 20 min
2. and then 150 ul of a nickel nitrate solution (150 mg/ml) was slowly added to the above solution by microinjection under continuous ultrasonication and stirring for 15 min. 
3. Subsequently,  the solution was stirred at 350 rpm/min for 4 h at room temperature, and excess nickel  salts were removed by vulgar centrifugation and further dried under vacuum overnight.  
4. After that, the light-green powder was sealed in a crucible with a cover and annealed in a muffle furnace at 1100 oC for 3 h in N2 atmosphere (20 ml/min) with the heating process: first increases to 350 oC at 5 oC per minute and then continues to rise to 1100 oC at 3 oC  /min. 
5. After cooling to room temperature in the furnace, the as-prepared single-atom Ni  sample was further washed with sulfuric acid (0.5 M) for 2 h to remove Ni particles and then centrifuged and dried to obtain the single-atom Ni catalyst.
