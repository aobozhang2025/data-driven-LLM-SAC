question
synthesis of single atom Ir doped by N supported on bulk carbon

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor IrCl3∙xH2O and support precursor GQDs–NH2 (graphene quantum dots functionalized with amine)

The support precursor GQDs–NH2 (graphene quantum dots functionalized with amine) are prepared as followed:
1. 8 grams of pyrene (Sigma, purity >98%) was nitrated into trinitropyrene in 640 millilitres of concentrated HNO3 (70%, Sigma) at 80 °C under refluxing and stirring for 12 h. 
2. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was washed to neutral pH using deionized (DI) water (18.2 MΩ) by centrifuging. 
3. The resultant yellow 1,3,6-trinitropyrene was then dried under vacuum at room temperature. 
4. Next, 1.2 grams of dried 1,3,6-trinitropyrene powder were dispersed into a solution containing 220 millilitres of DI water and 20 millilitres of concentrated ammonia solution (30%, Sigma). 
5. The above mixture was ultrasonicated in ice water using a batch sonicator for 4 h. 
6. Sixty millilitres of the homogeneous suspension were transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave (100 millilitres). 
7. The four autoclaves (total 240 millilitres mixture solution) were heated at 200 °C for 10 h. 
8. After natural cooling to room temperature, all the product-containing solution was filtered through a 0.22 μm microporous membrane to remove insoluble carbon product and further concentrated to ~90 millilitres by rotation drying.  

After the preparation of GQDs–NH2 (graphene quantum dots functionalized with amine), the synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. First, 1 gram of IrCl3∙xH2O (Alfa Aesar) was dissolved into 200 millilitres of DI water to prepare the IrCl3 stock solution with a concentration of ~5 milligrams per millilitre. 
2. 7 millilitres of IrCl3 stock solution were added to ~30 millilitres of purified GQDs–NH2 solution (~30 milligrams of GQDs–NH2). 
3. Then, the mixture solution was sonicated in ice water for 15 min, followed by being quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. 
4. After freeze drying, the as-prepared aerogel-like powder was mixed with urea (VWR) with a mass ratio of 1 to 10 and further heated in a tube furnace to 500 °C under a gas flow of 100 sccm Ar (UHP, Airgas) within 1 h, and kept at the same temperature for another 2 h before cooling to room temperature. 
5. Finally, the powder was collected.
