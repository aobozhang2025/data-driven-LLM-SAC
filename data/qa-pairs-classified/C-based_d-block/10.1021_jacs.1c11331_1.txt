question
Synthesis of single atom Ru doped by 4 N supported on carbon, dentoed by Ru-SAS/NC

answer
The catalyst is synthesized based on the synthesis framework of ZIF-8

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. 952 mg Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 100 mg Ru(acac)3 were dissolved in 12 mL of methanol with stirring for 10 min
2. and then 24 mL methanol containing1050 mg 2-Methylimidazole was added under vigorous stirring for another 10 min at room temperature. 
3. Subsequently, the mixture was transferred into a 50 mL of Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave for reaction at 120 °C for 4 h. 
4. After cooling to room temperature, the product was collected by centrifugation and washed with methanol four times, and finally dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven. 
5. The dried powder was added into a ceramic boat and heated in a quartz tube at 950 °C for 2 h under an Ar atmosphere with a heating  rate of 5 °C min-1.
