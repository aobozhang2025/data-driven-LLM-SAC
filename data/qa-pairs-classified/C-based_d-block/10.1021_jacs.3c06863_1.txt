question
Synthesis of single atom Cr doped by 4 N supported on N-doped Carbon

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor Cr(NO3)3·9H2O

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. Glucose (0.5 g) and dicyandiamide (10 g) were dissolved in 400 mL deionized water. 
2. Then, 2 mL of 0.025 M Cr(NO3)3·9H2O aqueous solution was added dropwise into the mixed solution. 
3. Subsequently, the mixture was heated at 80 oC under magnetic stirring to evaporate the vast majority of water. 
4. The residual solution was then frozen by a liquid nitrogen bath. 
5. The obtained solid product was ground into powder, and annealed at 900 °C for 2 h in Ar atmosphere.
