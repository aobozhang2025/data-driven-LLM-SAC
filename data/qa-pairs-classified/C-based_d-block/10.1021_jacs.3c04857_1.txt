question
synthesis of single atom Co doped by N supported on N-doped carbon

answer
The catalyst is synthesized with procedures as followed:
1. ((Tetraphenylporphinato)cobalt (Co-TPP, 5-200 mg) and 1,10- phenanthroline (10-300 mg) were dissolved in dichloromethane (40 mL)
2. then carbon powder (1 g, VULCAN® XC72R, Cabot Corporation Prod. Code XVC72R; CAS No. 1333-86-4) was introduced and the resulting mixture and further stirred vigorously at room temperature for 30 min. 
3. After that, dichloromethane was removed under vacuum. 
4. The obtained solid sample was successively dried at 60 °C overnight, grinded to fine powder, and heated to 800 °C for 3 h at a heating rate of 2 °C/min under flowing argon
