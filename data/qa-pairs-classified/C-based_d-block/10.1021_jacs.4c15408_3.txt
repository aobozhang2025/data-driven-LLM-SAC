question
Synthesis of single atom Co doped by N supported on carbon

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor ferric nitrate templated by SiO2

The template polydopamine-coated silica nanospheres denoted by SiO2@PDA, is first prepared as followed:
1. Ethanol (96 mL) and deionized water (320 mL) were mixed with NH3·H2O (4 mL), 
2. and then TEOS (4 mL) was added to form a uniform solution. 
3. 32 mL of the  prepared 50 g/L PDA aqueous solution was added to the mixture and stirred for 24 h. 
4. The obtained product was washed by centrifugation with ethanol and water, and then placed in a 60  oC oven under vacuum and collected 

After the synthesis of template polydopamine-coated silica nanospheres, catalyst synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. 200 mg SiO2@PDA and 0.1 mol/L  Co(NO3)2·6H2O were dispersed in deionized water and stirred overnight, then centrifuged and dried with water and ethanol to obtain SiO2@Co/PDA. 
2. The resulting mixture was centrifuged, washed, and placed in a 60 oC oven under vacuum to obtain its product SiO2@Co/PDA. 
3. For Co/NC, SiO2@Co/PDA was annealed at 900 oC in an argon atmosphere  for 2 h, and 2 mol/L NaOH solution at 80 oC for 5 h and a 0.5 mol/L H2SO4 solution at 90 oC  for 3 h were used to remove the SiO2 template and excess metal ions.
