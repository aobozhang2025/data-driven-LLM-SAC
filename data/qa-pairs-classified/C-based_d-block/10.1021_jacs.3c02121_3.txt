question
Synthesis of single atom Ir supported on UiO-66, denoted by Ir1/UiO-66 

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor IrCl3ꞏH2O and support UiO-66.

The support is prepared as followed:
1. 1.64 g of ZrCl4, and 1.16 g of H2BDC were first added in 80 mL DMF. 
2. Then, 3.5 mL HCl was successively dropped into the mixture, which was stirred constantly until all solid precursors completely dissolved.  
3. The obtained mixture was transferred to a 200 mL of hydrothermal reaction vessel with Teflon liner, which was kept at 120 °C for 24 h under static conditions. 
4. After cooling to room temperature, the solid MOFs were collected via high-speed centrifugation and thoroughly washed with DMF for three times, with 80 °C ultra-pure water for once and with acetone for three times. 
5. Finally, the UiO-66 were freeze-dried for 12 h prior to experiments.  

After the preparation of support UiO-66, the catalyst is synthesized by the following procedures:
1. 0.6 g UiO-66 was added to a solution containing 30 mg IrCl3ꞏH2O dissolved in 9 mL DMF. 
2. The mixture was sonicated for 5 minutes. 
3. The vials thread was sealed and heated in an 85 °C isothermal oven for 24  h. 
4. The product was collected via high-speed centrifugation and thoroughly washed with DMF for three times, with 80 °C ultra-pure water for once and with acetone for three  times. 
5. Finally, the Ir1/UiO-66 were freeze-dried for 12 h prior to experiments.
