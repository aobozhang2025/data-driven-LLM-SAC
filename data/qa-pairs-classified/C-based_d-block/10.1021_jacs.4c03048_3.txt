question
Synthesis of single atom Ir supported on C, denoted by Ir1/C.  

answer
The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor Na2IrCl6·6H2O and support C

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. C (1.0 g) was  impregnated with an aqueous solution of Na2IrCl6·6H2O at the desired mass ratio and kept for 6 h.  
2. After drying at 120 °C, the sample was impregnated with 2% aqueous ammonia and kept for 6 h to  remove chloride ions. 
3. The sample was then dried at 120 °C overnight, and then for about 20 min  naturally cooled to room temperature.
