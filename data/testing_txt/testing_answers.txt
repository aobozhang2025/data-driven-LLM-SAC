1. 4 mmol Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (1.736 g) and 0.48 mol NaOH (19.2 g) were dissolved in 80 ml distilled water and stirred for 30 min at room temperature. 
2. Then the solution was transferred to 100 ml Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave. 
3. After reacting at 100 oC for 12 h, the products were collected by centrifugation and washed with distilled water for several times. 
4. Upon drying in a vacuum for 12 h at 60 oC, the products were calcined at 400 oC in air for 1 h. porous CeO2 was obtained

After the preparation of porous CeO2, the catalyst is synthesized as followed:
5. 500 mg of the synthesized porous CeO2 was first dispersed in 175 mL of distilled water, and 1 mmol ascorbic acid (AA) was added to the solution. 
6. After being stirred at room temperature for 3 h, the products were collected by centrifugation, washed with distilled water several times, dried under vacuum, and denoted as CeO2-AA. 
7. 140 mg CeO2-AA particles were then redispersed in 55 mL of distilled water, and 0.01 mmol metal precursor (PdCl2) was added. 
8. After the mixture was stirred for 3 h at room temperature, the products were collected by centrifugation and washed with water several times. 5. After being dried under vacuum, the products were calcinated at 300 °C in the air for 5 h to remove the excess AA

The catalyst is prepared impregnation with metal precursor Rh (III) nitrate hydrate and support CeO2 nanorod

The support CeO2 nanorod is prepared as followed:
1. 1.736 g of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (Aldrich, 99.99%) was dissolved in 10ml of deionized water then added dropwise to a concentrated NaOH solution, forming a mixed solution of Ce(NO3)3. 
2. The concentrated NaOH solution was prepared by dissolving 19.2g of NaOH (Aldrich, >98%) in 70ml of deionized water. 
3. Then, the mixed solution of Ce(NO3)3 was maintained under vigorous stirring for 30 min before being transferred to a Teflon-lined, stainless steel autoclave for hydrothermal treatment at 100°C for 24h. 
4. Following hydrothermal synthesis, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature. 
5. The yellow powder thus obtained was washed with deionized water until its pH became neutral. 
6. Finally, the powder was dried at 60°C in air for 10h. 

After the support CeO2 nanorod is prepared, the catalyst is synthesized as followed:
1. 1.0 g of CeO2 nanorods was dispersed in 50 ml of deionized water. 
2. The mixture was sonicated for 10 min and stirred at 400 r.p.m. for 1 h; at this stage it is termed CeO2 aqueous dispersion. 
3. Then, 5.6 mg of Rh (III) nitrate hydrate (Aldrich, ~36% Rh basis), which provided ~2.0 mg of Rh metal, was weighed and dissolved in 20 ml of deionized water. 
4. The prepared Rh salt solution was slowly introduced into the prepared CeO2 aqueous dispersion by syringe pump at a flow rate of 0.2 ml min–1 while the aqueous solution was being stirred, creating an aqueous mixture containing both Rh3+ and CeO2 nanorods. 
5. This aqueous mixture of Rh3+ and ceria nanorods was continuously stirred for an additional 3 h. 
6. The pH of the mixture was carefully adjusted to 9.5 by gradual introduction of ammonium hydroxide solution (Aldrich, 28%) while the aqueous mixture was being stirred, followed by continuous stirring for an additional 5 h. 
7. The aqueous mixture was then centrifuged at 3,000 r.p.m. for 5 min, after which the upper layer was decanted. 
8. The solid product thus obtained was dried at 60 °C in an oven overnight and calcined in a muffle furnace at 250 °C for 2 h

The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor Rhodium(III) nitrate hydrate, Rh(NO3)3·2H2O (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich) and support TiO2 nanopowder with primary particle size at 21 nm  or so (Titania, ≥99.95%, Aeroxide P25, Sigma-Aldrich)

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. 500 mg of TiO2 was mixed with 50 mL of deionized water through a vigorous stirring to form a white suspension. 
2. A 3.0 mL Rh(NO3)3· 2H2O aqueous solution (2.84 × 10−3 mol/L) was introduced to the TiO2 suspension through a precise injection with a syringe pump while the solution was vigorously stirred. The nominal loading is 0.20 wt %. 
3. The new suspension was continuously stirred for 2 h more to allow sufficient spontaneous adsorption of metal ions. 
4. The pH value of the mixture was carefully adjusted to 9.5 by gradually introducing an ammonium hydroxide solution, followed by vigorous stirring for another 6 h in order to reach a steady equilibrium in solution. 
5. Then, the prepared solution was centrifuged and then dried at 60 °C overnight with a following calcination in muffle furnace at 650 °C in air for 4 h.
