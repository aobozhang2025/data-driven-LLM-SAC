The obtained powder was calcined in a muffle furnace at 420 °C for 4 h."

Selected amounts of sodium tetrachloropalladate solution (34 mM) was added under stirring. \n3. Following 30  min of stirring in Ar, the resultant solution was frozen with liquid nitrogen and irradiated via a 300 W xenon lamp for 4 min. \n4. The products were washed 4 times with ultra-pure water and dried at room temperature (RT) under vacuum for 12 h."

The resulting light yellow solid was ground again with mortar and pestle and stored for later use.  \n\nAfter the support CeO2 is prepared, the catalyst is synthesized by the following procedures:\n1. 1 g of CeO2 powder was combined with 99 mg of rhodium (III) acetylacetylonate (97%, Sigma Aldrich 282774) and approx. 3 mL of acetone in a heated (~80oC) mortar. \n2. Rhodium (III) acetylacetylonate (97%, Sigma Aldrich 282774) dissolved completely in acetone, and the mixture was ground with a pestle until all of the acetone evaporated. \n3. The resulting powder was transferred to a combustion boat, dried at 80 oC for 30 minutes, and transferred to a muffle furnace, where it was heated in static air at 800oC for 10 hours with a 10oC/min ramp rate."
