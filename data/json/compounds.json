This N-doping enhances metal anchoring and catalytic activity.\n\nCarbon Source (Minor):\nUrea contributes a small amount of carbon during decomposition but is primarily used alongside other carbon-rich precursors (e.g., glucose, melamine).\n\nMetal Stabilization:\nNitrogen functionalities (e.g., pyridinic-N, graphitic-N) generated from urea can coordinate with metal atoms (e.g., Fe, Co, Ni) to anchor them as single atoms, preventing agglomeration during high-temperature treatments.\n\nPorogen Effect:\nDecomposition of urea releases gases (NH₃, CO₂), which can help generate porosity in the carbon structure, enhancing surface area and accessibility of SAC sites.\n\nCost-effective and Water-soluble:\nUrea is cheap, non-toxic, and dissolves easily in water, making it compatible with wet impregnation, hydrothermal, or sol-gel SAC synthesis methods."

Ensure the choice of metal precursor is compatible with urea-derived species.\n\nOdor and Corrosive Gases:\nAmmonia evolution during pyrolysis can be irritating or corrosive. Use fume hoods or inert atmosphere setups (e.g., N₂, Ar) when handling thermal treatment.\n\nUncontrolled Nitrogen Doping:\nExcess urea can lead to non-uniform or excessive N-doping, which may alter the support conductivity or pore structure adversely. Stoichiometry and precursor ratios must be optimized.\n\nMoisture Sensitivity:\nUrea is hygroscopic and can clump in humid environments, leading to uneven dispersion in solid mixtures.

This is critical for controlled single-atom catalyst synthesis.\nCorrosiveness & Toxicity: ZrCl₄ and ZrOCl₂ release corrosive HCl fumes upon contact with water. Proper ventilation and protective equipment are necessary.\nOxidizing Nature: Nitrates are strong oxidizers and should be handled away from flammable materials.\nHandling Requirements: Alkoxides require inert atmosphere to prevent rapid hydrolysis, typically handled inside gloveboxes or under dry nitrogen/argon flow.\nSolubility: Solubility varies: chlorides and nitrates are water soluble, alkoxides dissolve in organic solvents, influencing the choice depending on the synthesis route."
