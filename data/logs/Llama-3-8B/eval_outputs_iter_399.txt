<|User|>:Synthesis of single atom Rh supported on CeO2.
<|Bot|>:The catalyst is synthesized by impregnation with metal precursor RhCl3 and support CeO2

The synthesis procedures are as followed:
1. First, 50 mg of commercial CeO2 was dispersed in 10 ml of ultrapure water, followed by the dropwise addition of 1 ml of ethylenediamine solution containing 5 mmol lit-1 RhCl3.
2. After impregnation, the catalyst was dried at 80 °C for 12 h and then calcined at 500 °C for 2 h in air.<|end_of_text|>

<|User|>:Synthesis of single atom metal Mn tetrahedron coordinated supported on ZnO
<|Bot|>:The catalyst is synthesized with the following procedures:
1. Mn acetylacetonates and Zn acetylacetonates with a molar ratio of 1:20 were ultrasonically dissolved in octane.
2. Then tetrahydrofuran was added as the template to form a systematic micellar solution.
3. Mn acetylacetonates and Zn acetylacetonates were deposited in the center of THF micelles.
4. The mixed solutions were dried at 60 oC under continuous stirring to remove the solvent completely.
5. The remaining solid powder was then calcined at 400 oC for 2 h in a muffle furnace to obtain the final catalyst.<|end_of_text|>
